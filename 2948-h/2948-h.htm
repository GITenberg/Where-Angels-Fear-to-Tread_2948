    <h2>
      Chapter 1
    </h2>
    <p>
      They were all at Charing Cross to see Lilia off&mdash;Philip, Harriet,
      Irma, Mrs. Herriton herself. Even Mrs. Theobald, squired by Mr. Kingcroft,
      had braved the journey from Yorkshire to bid her only daughter good-bye.
      Miss Abbott was likewise attended by numerous relatives, and the sight of
      so many people talking at once and saying such different things caused
      Lilia to break into ungovernable peals of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite an ovation,&rdquo; she cried, sprawling out of her first-class carriage.
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll take us for royalty. Oh, Mr. Kingcroft, get us foot-warmers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good-natured young man hurried away, and Philip, taking his place,
      flooded her with a final stream of advice and injunctions&mdash;where to
      stop, how to learn Italian, when to use mosquito-nets, what pictures to
      look at. &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;that it is only by going off the track
      that you get to know the country. See the little towns&mdash;Gubbio,
      Pienza, Cortona, San Gemignano, Monteriano. And don&rsquo;t, let me beg you, go
      with that awful tourist idea that Italy&rsquo;s only a museum of antiquities and
      art. Love and understand the Italians, for the people are more marvellous
      than the land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How I wish you were coming, Philip,&rdquo; she said, flattered at the unwonted
      notice her brother-in-law was giving her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I were.&rdquo; He could have managed it without great difficulty, for
      his career at the Bar was not so intense as to prevent occasional
      holidays. But his family disliked his continual visits to the Continent,
      and he himself often found pleasure in the idea that he was too busy to
      leave town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, dear every one. What a whirl!&rdquo; She caught sight of her little
      daughter Irma, and felt that a touch of maternal solemnity was required.
      &ldquo;Good-bye, darling. Mind you&rsquo;re always good, and do what Granny tells
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She referred not to her own mother, but to her mother-in-law, Mrs.
      Herriton, who hated the title of Granny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irma lifted a serious face to be kissed, and said cautiously, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my
      best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is sure to be good,&rdquo; said Mrs. Herriton, who was standing pensively a
      little out of the hubbub. But Lilia was already calling to Miss Abbott, a
      tall, grave, rather nice-looking young lady who was conducting her adieus
      in a more decorous manner on the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caroline, my Caroline! Jump in, or your chaperon will go off without
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Philip, whom the idea of Italy always intoxicated, had started again,
      telling her of the supreme moments of her coming journey&mdash;the
      Campanile of Airolo, which would burst on her when she emerged from the
      St. Gothard tunnel, presaging the future; the view of the Ticino and Lago
      Maggiore as the train climbed the slopes of Monte Cenere; the view of
      Lugano, the view of Como&mdash;Italy gathering thick around her now&mdash;the
      arrival at her first resting-place, when, after long driving through dark
      and dirty streets, she should at last behold, amid the roar of trams and
      the glare of arc lamps, the buttresses of the cathedral of Milan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Handkerchiefs and collars,&rdquo; screamed Harriet, &ldquo;in my inlaid box! I&rsquo;ve
      lent you my inlaid box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good old Harry!&rdquo; She kissed every one again, and there was a moment&rsquo;s
      silence. They all smiled steadily, excepting Philip, who was choking in
      the fog, and old Mrs. Theobald, who had begun to cry. Miss Abbott got into
      the carriage. The guard himself shut the door, and told Lilia that she
      would be all right. Then the train moved, and they all moved with it a
      couple of steps, and waved their handkerchiefs, and uttered cheerful
      little cries. At that moment Mr. Kingcroft reappeared, carrying a
      footwarmer by both ends, as if it was a tea-tray. He was sorry that he was
      too late, and called out in a quivering voice, &ldquo;Good-bye, Mrs. Charles.
      May you enjoy yourself, and may God bless you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lilia smiled and nodded, and then the absurd position of the foot-warmer
      overcame her, and she began to laugh again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am so sorry,&rdquo; she cried back, &ldquo;but you do look so funny. Oh, you
      all look so funny waving! Oh, pray!&rdquo; And laughing helplessly, she was
      carried out into the fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;High spirits to begin so long a journey,&rdquo; said Mrs. Theobald, dabbing her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kingcroft solemnly moved his head in token of agreement. &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo;
       said he, &ldquo;that Mrs. Charles had gotten the footwarmer. These London
      porters won&rsquo;t take heed to a country chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you did your best,&rdquo; said Mrs. Herriton. &ldquo;And I think it simply noble
      of you to have brought Mrs. Theobald all the way here on such a day as
      this.&rdquo; Then, rather hastily, she shook hands, and left him to take Mrs.
      Theobald all the way back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sawston, her own home, was within easy reach of London, and they were not
      late for tea. Tea was in the dining-room, with an egg for Irma, to keep up
      the child&rsquo;s spirits. The house seemed strangely quiet after a fortnight&rsquo;s
      bustle, and their conversation was spasmodic and subdued. They wondered
      whether the travellers had got to Folkestone, whether it would be at all
      rough, and if so what would happen to poor Miss Abbott.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, Granny, when will the old ship get to Italy?&rdquo; asked Irma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Grandmother,&rsquo; dear; not &lsquo;Granny,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Mrs. Herriton, giving her a
      kiss. &ldquo;And we say &lsquo;a boat&rsquo; or &lsquo;a steamer,&rsquo; not &lsquo;a ship.&rsquo; Ships have sails.
      And mother won&rsquo;t go all the way by sea. You look at the map of Europe, and
      you&rsquo;ll see why. Harriet, take her. Go with Aunt Harriet, and she&rsquo;ll show
      you the map.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Righto!&rdquo; said the little girl, and dragged the reluctant Harriet into the
      library. Mrs. Herriton and her son were left alone. There was immediately
      confidence between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here beginneth the New Life,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child, how vulgar!&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Herriton. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s surprising that
      she isn&rsquo;t worse. But she has got a look of poor Charles about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;alas, alas!&mdash;a look of old Mrs. Theobald. What appalling
      apparition was that! I did think the lady was bedridden as well as
      imbecile. Why ever did she come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Kingcroft made her. I am certain of it. He wanted to see Lilia again,
      and this was the only way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he is satisfied. I did not think my sister-in-law distinguished
      herself in her farewells.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Herriton shuddered. &ldquo;I mind nothing, so long as she has gone&mdash;and
      gone with Miss Abbott. It is mortifying to think that a widow of
      thirty-three requires a girl ten years younger to look after her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pity Miss Abbott. Fortunately one admirer is chained to England. Mr.
      Kingcroft cannot leave the crops or the climate or something. I don&rsquo;t
      think, either, he improved his chances today. He, as well as Lilia, has
      the knack of being absurd in public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Herriton replied, &ldquo;When a man is neither well bred, nor well
      connected, nor handsome, nor clever, nor rich, even Lilia may discard him
      in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I believe she would take any one. Right up to the last, when her
      boxes were packed, she was &lsquo;playing&rsquo; the chinless curate. Both the curates
      are chinless, but hers had the dampest hands. I came on them in the Park.
      They were speaking of the Pentateuch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy! If possible, she has got worse and worse. It was your idea
      of Italian travel that saved us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip brightened at the little compliment. &ldquo;The odd part is that she was
      quite eager&mdash;always asking me for information; and of course I was
      very glad to give it. I admit she is a Philistine, appallingly ignorant,
      and her taste in art is false. Still, to have any taste at all is
      something. And I do believe that Italy really purifies and ennobles all
      who visit her. She is the school as well as the playground of the world.
      It is really to Lilia&rsquo;s credit that she wants to go there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would go anywhere,&rdquo; said his mother, who had heard enough of the
      praises of Italy. &ldquo;I and Caroline Abbott had the greatest difficulty in
      dissuading her from the Riviera.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mother; no. She was really keen on Italy. This travel is quite a
      crisis for her.&rdquo; He found the situation full of whimsical romance: there
      was something half attractive, half repellent in the thought of this
      vulgar woman journeying to places he loved and revered. Why should she not
      be transfigured? The same had happened to the Goths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Herriton did not believe in romance nor in transfiguration, nor in
      parallels from history, nor in anything else that may disturb domestic
      life. She adroitly changed the subject before Philip got excited. Soon
      Harriet returned, having given her lesson in geography. Irma went to bed
      early, and was tucked up by her grandmother. Then the two ladies worked
      and played cards. Philip read a book. And so they all settled down to
      their quiet, profitable existence, and continued it without interruption
      through the winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now nearly ten years since Charles had fallen in love with Lilia
      Theobald because she was pretty, and during that time Mrs. Herriton had
      hardly known a moment&rsquo;s rest. For six months she schemed to prevent the
      match, and when it had taken place she turned to another task&mdash;the
      supervision of her daughter-in-law. Lilia must be pushed through life
      without bringing discredit on the family into which she had married. She
      was aided by Charles, by her daughter Harriet, and, as soon as he was old
      enough, by the clever one of the family, Philip. The birth of Irma made
      things still more difficult. But fortunately old Mrs. Theobald, who had
      attempted interference, began to break up. It was an effort to her to
      leave Whitby, and Mrs. Herriton discouraged the effort as far as possible.
      That curious duel which is fought over every baby was fought and decided
      early. Irma belonged to her father&rsquo;s family, not to her mother&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles died, and the struggle recommenced. Lilia tried to assert herself,
      and said that she should go to take care of Mrs. Theobald. It required all
      Mrs. Herriton&rsquo;s kindness to prevent her. A house was finally taken for her
      at Sawston, and there for three years she lived with Irma, continually
      subject to the refining influences of her late husband&rsquo;s family.
    </p>
    <p>
      During one of her rare Yorkshire visits trouble began again. Lilia
      confided to a friend that she liked a Mr. Kingcroft extremely, but that
      she was not exactly engaged to him. The news came round to Mrs. Herriton,
      who at once wrote, begging for information, and pointing out that Lilia
      must either be engaged or not, since no intermediate state existed. It was
      a good letter, and flurried Lilia extremely. She left Mr. Kingcroft
      without even the pressure of a rescue-party. She cried a great deal on her
      return to Sawston, and said she was very sorry. Mrs. Herriton took the
      opportunity of speaking more seriously about the duties of widowhood and
      motherhood than she had ever done before. But somehow things never went
      easily after. Lilia would not settle down in her place among Sawston
      matrons. She was a bad housekeeper, always in the throes of some domestic
      crisis, which Mrs. Herriton, who kept her servants for years, had to step
      across and adjust. She let Irma stop away from school for insufficient
      reasons, and she allowed her to wear rings. She learnt to bicycle, for the
      purpose of waking the place up, and coasted down the High Street one
      Sunday evening, falling off at the turn by the church. If she had not been
      a relative, it would have been entertaining. But even Philip, who in
      theory loved outraging English conventions, rose to the occasion, and gave
      her a talking which she remembered to her dying day. It was just then,
      too, that they discovered that she still allowed Mr. Kingcroft to write to
      her &ldquo;as a gentleman friend,&rdquo; and to send presents to Irma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip thought of Italy, and the situation was saved. Caroline, charming,
      sober, Caroline Abbott, who lived two turnings away, was seeking a
      companion for a year&rsquo;s travel. Lilia gave up her house, sold half her
      furniture, left the other half and Irma with Mrs. Herriton, and had now
      departed, amid universal approval, for a change of scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrote to them frequently during the winter&mdash;more frequently than
      she wrote to her mother. Her letters were always prosperous. Florence she
      found perfectly sweet, Naples a dream, but very whiffy. In Rome one had
      simply to sit still and feel. Philip, however, declared that she was
      improving. He was particularly gratified when in the early spring she
      began to visit the smaller towns that he had recommended. &ldquo;In a place like
      this,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;one really does feel in the heart of things, and off
      the beaten track. Looking out of a Gothic window every morning, it seems
      impossible that the middle ages have passed away.&rdquo; The letter was from
      Monteriano, and concluded with a not unsuccessful description of the
      wonderful little town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is something that she is contented,&rdquo; said Mrs. Herriton. &ldquo;But no one
      could live three months with Caroline Abbott and not be the better for
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then Irma came in from school, and she read her mother&rsquo;s letter to
      her, carefully correcting any grammatical errors, for she was a loyal
      supporter of parental authority&mdash;Irma listened politely, but soon
      changed the subject to hockey, in which her whole being was absorbed. They
      were to vote for colours that afternoon&mdash;yellow and white or yellow
      and green. What did her grandmother think?
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Mrs. Herriton had an opinion, which she sedately expounded, in
      spite of Harriet, who said that colours were unnecessary for children, and
      of Philip, who said that they were ugly. She was getting proud of Irma,
      who had certainly greatly improved, and could no longer be called that
      most appalling of things&mdash;a vulgar child. She was anxious to form her
      before her mother returned. So she had no objection to the leisurely
      movements of the travellers, and even suggested that they should overstay
      their year if it suited them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilia&rsquo;s next letter was also from Monteriano, and Philip grew quite
      enthusiastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve stopped there over a week!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Why! I shouldn&rsquo;t have done
      as much myself. They must be really keen, for the hotel&rsquo;s none too
      comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot understand people,&rdquo; said Harriet. &ldquo;What can they be doing all
      day? And there is no church there, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is Santa Deodata, one of the most beautiful churches in Italy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I mean an English church,&rdquo; said Harriet stiffly. &ldquo;Lilia
      promised me that she would always be in a large town on Sundays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she goes to a service at Santa Deodata&rsquo;s, she will find more beauty
      and sincerity than there is in all the Back Kitchens of Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Back Kitchen was his nickname for St. James&rsquo;s, a small depressing
      edifice much patronized by his sister. She always resented any slight on
      it, and Mrs. Herriton had to intervene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, dears, don&rsquo;t. Listen to Lilia&rsquo;s letter. &lsquo;We love this place, and I
      do not know how I shall ever thank Philip for telling me it. It is not
      only so quaint, but one sees the Italians unspoiled in all their
      simplicity and charm here. The frescoes are wonderful. Caroline, who grows
      sweeter every day, is very busy sketching.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one to his taste!&rdquo; said Harriet, who always delivered a platitude
      as if it was an epigram. She was curiously virulent about Italy, which she
      had never visited, her only experience of the Continent being an
      occasional six weeks in the Protestant parts of Switzerland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Harriet is a bad lot!&rdquo; said Philip as soon as she left the room. His
      mother laughed, and told him not to be naughty; and the appearance of
      Irma, just off to school, prevented further discussion. Not only in Tracts
      is a child a peacemaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, Irma,&rdquo; said her uncle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to the station. I&rsquo;ll give
      you the pleasure of my company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They started together. Irma was gratified; but conversation flagged, for
      Philip had not the art of talking to the young. Mrs. Herriton sat a little
      longer at the breakfast table, re-reading Lilia&rsquo;s letter. Then she helped
      the cook to clear, ordered dinner, and started the housemaid turning out
      the drawing-room, Tuesday being its day. The weather was lovely, and she
      thought she would do a little gardening, as it was quite early. She called
      Harriet, who had recovered from the insult to St. James&rsquo;s, and together
      they went to the kitchen garden and began to sow some early vegetables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will save the peas to the last; they are the greatest fun,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Herriton, who had the gift of making work a treat. She and her elderly
      daughter always got on very well, though they had not a great deal in
      common. Harriet&rsquo;s education had been almost too successful. As Philip once
      said, she had &ldquo;bolted all the cardinal virtues and couldn&rsquo;t digest them.&rdquo;
       Though pious and patriotic, and a great moral asset for the house, she
      lacked that pliancy and tact which her mother so much valued, and had
      expected her to pick up for herself. Harriet, if she had been allowed,
      would have driven Lilia to an open rupture, and, what was worse, she would
      have done the same to Philip two years before, when he returned full of
      passion for Italy, and ridiculing Sawston and its ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame, Mother!&rdquo; she had cried. &ldquo;Philip laughs at everything&mdash;the
      Book Club, the Debating Society, the Progressive Whist, the bazaars.
      People won&rsquo;t like it. We have our reputation. A house divided against
      itself cannot stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Herriton replied in the memorable words, &ldquo;Let Philip say what he
      likes, and he will let us do what we like.&rdquo; And Harriet had acquiesced.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sowed the duller vegetables first, and a pleasant feeling of
      righteous fatigue stole over them as they addressed themselves to the
      peas. Harriet stretched a string to guide the row straight, and Mrs.
      Herriton scratched a furrow with a pointed stick. At the end of it she
      looked at her watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s twelve! The second post&rsquo;s in. Run and see if there are any letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet did not want to go. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s finish the peas. There won&rsquo;t be any
      letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear; please go. I&rsquo;ll sow the peas, but you shall cover them up&mdash;and
      mind the birds don&rsquo;t see &lsquo;em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Herriton was very careful to let those peas trickle evenly from her
      hand, and at the end of the row she was conscious that she had never sown
      better. They were expensive too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Actually old Mrs. Theobald!&rdquo; said Harriet, returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read me the letter. My hands are dirty. How intolerable the crested paper
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet opened the envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t make sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her letters never did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it must be sillier than usual,&rdquo; said Harriet, and her voice began to
      quaver. &ldquo;Look here, read it, Mother; I can&rsquo;t make head or tail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Herriton took the letter indulgently. &ldquo;What is the difficulty?&rdquo; she
      said after a long pause. &ldquo;What is it that puzzles you in this letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The meaning&mdash;&rdquo; faltered Harriet. The sparrows hopped nearer and
      began to eye the peas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The meaning is quite clear&mdash;Lilia is engaged to be married. Don&rsquo;t
      cry, dear; please me by not crying&mdash;don&rsquo;t talk at all. It&rsquo;s more than
      I could bear. She is going to marry some one she has met in a hotel. Take
      the letter and read for yourself.&rdquo; Suddenly she broke down over what might
      seem a small point. &ldquo;How dare she not tell me direct! How dare she write
      first to Yorkshire! Pray, am I to hear through Mrs. Theobald&mdash;a
      patronizing, insolent letter like this? Have I no claim at all? Bear
      witness, dear&rdquo;&mdash;she choked with passion&mdash;&ldquo;bear witness that for
      this I&rsquo;ll never forgive her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what is to be done?&rdquo; moaned Harriet. &ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This first!&rdquo; She tore the letter into little pieces and scattered it over
      the mould. &ldquo;Next, a telegram for Lilia! No! a telegram for Miss Caroline
      Abbott. She, too, has something to explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what is to be done?&rdquo; repeated Harriet, as she followed her mother to
      the house. She was helpless before such effrontery. What awful thing&mdash;what
      awful person had come to Lilia? &ldquo;Some one in the hotel.&rdquo; The letter only
      said that. What kind of person? A gentleman? An Englishman? The letter did
      not say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wire reason of stay at Monteriano. Strange rumours,&rdquo; read Mrs. Herriton,
      and addressed the telegram to Abbott, Stella d&rsquo;Italia, Monteriano, Italy.
      &ldquo;If there is an office there,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;we might get an answer this
      evening. Since Philip is back at seven, and the eight-fifteen catches the
      midnight boat at Dover&mdash;Harriet, when you go with this, get 100
      pounds in 5 pound notes at the bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, dear, at once; do not talk. I see Irma coming back; go quickly....
      Well, Irma dear, and whose team are you in this afternoon&mdash;Miss
      Edith&rsquo;s or Miss May&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But as soon as she had behaved as usual to her grand-daughter, she went to
      the library and took out the large atlas, for she wanted to know about
      Monteriano. The name was in the smallest print, in the midst of a
      woolly-brown tangle of hills which were called the &ldquo;Sub-Apennines.&rdquo; It was
      not so very far from Siena, which she had learnt at school. Past it there
      wandered a thin black line, notched at intervals like a saw, and she knew
      that this was a railway. But the map left a good deal to imagination, and
      she had not got any. She looked up the place in &ldquo;Childe Harold,&rdquo; but Byron
      had not been there. Nor did Mark Twain visit it in the &ldquo;Tramp Abroad.&rdquo; The
      resources of literature were exhausted: she must wait till Philip came
      home. And the thought of Philip made her try Philip&rsquo;s room, and there she
      found &ldquo;Central Italy,&rdquo; by Baedeker, and opened it for the first time in
      her life and read in it as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MONTERIANO (pop. 4800). Hotels: Stella d&rsquo;Italia, moderate only; Globo,
      dirty. * Caffe Garibaldi. Post and Telegraph office in Corso Vittorio
      Emmanuele, next to theatre. Photographs at Seghena&rsquo;s (cheaper in
      Florence). Diligence (1 lira) meets principal trains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chief attractions (2-3 hours): Santa Deodata, Palazzo Pubblico, Sant&rsquo; 
      Agostino, Santa Caterina, Sant&rsquo; Ambrogio, Palazzo Capocchi. Guide (2 lire)
      unnecessary. A walk round the Walls should on no account be omitted. The
      view from the Rocca (small gratuity) is finest at sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      History: Monteriano, the Mons Rianus of Antiquity, whose Ghibelline
      tendencies are noted by Dante (Purg. xx.), definitely emancipated itself
      from Poggibonsi in 1261. Hence the distich, &ldquo;POGGIBONIZZI, FAUI IN LA, CHE
      MONTERIANO SI FA CITTA!&rdquo; till recently enscribed over the Siena gate. It
      remained independent till 1530, when it was sacked by the Papal troops and
      became part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. It is now of small importance,
      and seat of the district prison. The inhabitants are still noted for their
      agreeable manners.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The traveller will proceed direct from the Siena gate to the Collegiate
      Church of Santa Deodata, and inspect (5th chapel on right) the charming
      Frescoes....
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Herriton did not proceed. She was not one to detect the hidden charms
      of Baedeker. Some of the information seemed to her unnecessary, all of it
      was dull. Whereas Philip could never read &ldquo;The view from the Rocca (small
      gratuity) is finest at sunset&rdquo; without a catching at the heart. Restoring
      the book to its place, she went downstairs, and looked up and down the
      asphalt paths for her daughter. She saw her at last, two turnings away,
      vainly trying to shake off Mr. Abbott, Miss Caroline Abbott&rsquo;s father.
      Harriet was always unfortunate. At last she returned, hot, agitated,
      crackling with bank-notes, and Irma bounced to greet her, and trod heavily
      on her corn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your feet grow larger every day,&rdquo; said the agonized Harriet, and gave her
      niece a violent push. Then Irma cried, and Mrs. Herriton was annoyed with
      Harriet for betraying irritation. Lunch was nasty; and during pudding news
      arrived that the cook, by sheer dexterity, had broken a very vital knob
      off the kitchen-range. &ldquo;It is too bad,&rdquo; said Mrs. Herriton. Irma said it
      was three bad, and was told not to be rude. After lunch Harriet would get
      out Baedeker, and read in injured tones about Monteriano, the Mons Rianus
      of Antiquity, till her mother stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ridiculous to read, dear. She&rsquo;s not trying to marry any one in the
      place. Some tourist, obviously, who&rsquo;s stopping in the hotel. The place has
      nothing to do with it at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what a place to go to! What nice person, too, do you meet in a
      hotel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice or nasty, as I have told you several times before, is not the point.
      Lilia has insulted our family, and she shall suffer for it. And when you
      speak against hotels, I think you forget that I met your father at
      Chamounix. You can contribute nothing, dear, at present, and I think you
      had better hold your tongue. I am going to the kitchen, to speak about the
      range.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke just too much, and the cook said that if she could not give
      satisfaction&mdash;she had better leave. A small thing at hand is greater
      than a great thing remote, and Lilia, misconducting herself upon a
      mountain in Central Italy, was immediately hidden. Mrs. Herriton flew to a
      registry office, failed; flew to another, failed again; came home, was
      told by the housemaid that things seemed so unsettled that she had better
      leave as well; had tea, wrote six letters, was interrupted by cook and
      housemaid, both weeping, asking her pardon, and imploring to be taken
      back. In the flush of victory the door-bell rang, and there was the
      telegram: &ldquo;Lilia engaged to Italian nobility. Writing. Abbott.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No answer,&rdquo; said Mrs. Herriton. &ldquo;Get down Mr. Philip&rsquo;s Gladstone from the
      attic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She would not allow herself to be frightened by the unknown. Indeed she
      knew a little now. The man was not an Italian noble, otherwise the
      telegram would have said so. It must have been written by Lilia. None but
      she would have been guilty of the fatuous vulgarity of &ldquo;Italian nobility.&rdquo;
       She recalled phrases of this morning&rsquo;s letter: &ldquo;We love this place&mdash;Caroline
      is sweeter than ever, and busy sketching&mdash;Italians full of simplicity
      and charm.&rdquo; And the remark of Baedeker, &ldquo;The inhabitants are still noted
      for their agreeable manners,&rdquo; had a baleful meaning now. If Mrs. Herriton
      had no imagination, she had intuition, a more useful quality, and the
      picture she made to herself of Lilia&rsquo;s FIANCE did not prove altogether
      wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Philip was received with the news that he must start in half an hour
      for Monteriano. He was in a painful position. For three years he had sung
      the praises of the Italians, but he had never contemplated having one as a
      relative. He tried to soften the thing down to his mother, but in his
      heart of hearts he agreed with her when she said, &ldquo;The man may be a duke
      or he may be an organ-grinder. That is not the point. If Lilia marries him
      she insults the memory of Charles, she insults Irma, she insults us.
      Therefore I forbid her, and if she disobeys we have done with her for
      ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do all I can,&rdquo; said Philip in a low voice. It was the first time
      he had had anything to do. He kissed his mother and sister and puzzled
      Irma. The hall was warm and attractive as he looked back into it from the
      cold March night, and he departed for Italy reluctantly, as for something
      commonplace and dull.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Mrs. Herriton went to bed she wrote to Mrs. Theobald, using plain
      language about Lilia&rsquo;s conduct, and hinting that it was a question on
      which every one must definitely choose sides. She added, as if it was an
      afterthought, that Mrs. Theobald&rsquo;s letter had arrived that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as she was going upstairs she remembered that she never covered up
      those peas. It upset her more than anything, and again and again she
      struck the banisters with vexation. Late as it was, she got a lantern from
      the tool-shed and went down the garden to rake the earth over them. The
      sparrows had taken every one. But countless fragments of the letter
      remained, disfiguring the tidy ground.

    <h2>
      Chapter 2
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the bewildered tourist alights at the station of Monteriano, he finds
      himself in the middle of the country. There are a few houses round the
      railway, and many more dotted over the plain and the slopes of the hills,
      but of a town, mediaeval or otherwise, not the slightest sign. He must
      take what is suitably termed a &ldquo;legno&rdquo;&mdash;a piece of wood&mdash;and
      drive up eight miles of excellent road into the middle ages. For it is
      impossible, as well as sacrilegious, to be as quick as Baedeker.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was three in the afternoon when Philip left the realms of commonsense.
      He was so weary with travelling that he had fallen asleep in the train.
      His fellow-passengers had the usual Italian gift of divination, and when
      Monteriano came they knew he wanted to go there, and dropped him out. His
      feet sank into the hot asphalt of the platform, and in a dream he watched
      the train depart, while the porter who ought to have been carrying his
      bag, ran up the line playing touch-you-last with the guard. Alas! he was
      in no humour for Italy. Bargaining for a legno bored him unutterably. The
      man asked six lire; and though Philip knew that for eight miles it should
      scarcely be more than four, yet he was about to give what he was asked,
      and so make the man discontented and unhappy for the rest of the day. He
      was saved from this social blunder by loud shouts, and looking up the road
      saw one cracking his whip and waving his reins and driving two horses
      furiously, and behind him there appeared the swaying figure of a woman,
      holding star-fish fashion on to anything she could touch. It was Miss
      Abbott, who had just received his letter from Milan announcing the time of
      his arrival, and had hurried down to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had known Miss Abbott for years, and had never had much opinion about
      her one way or the other. She was good, quiet, dull, and amiable, and
      young only because she was twenty-three: there was nothing in her
      appearance or manner to suggest the fire of youth. All her life had been
      spent at Sawston with a dull and amiable father, and her pleasant, pallid
      face, bent on some respectable charity, was a familiar object of the
      Sawston streets. Why she had ever wished to leave them was surprising; but
      as she truly said, &ldquo;I am John Bull to the backbone, yet I do want to see
      Italy, just once. Everybody says it is marvellous, and that one gets no
      idea of it from books at all.&rdquo; The curate suggested that a year was a long
      time; and Miss Abbott, with decorous playfulness, answered him, &ldquo;Oh, but
      you must let me have my fling! I promise to have it once, and once only.
      It will give me things to think about and talk about for the rest of my
      life.&rdquo; The curate had consented; so had Mr. Abbott. And here she was in a
      legno, solitary, dusty, frightened, with as much to answer and to answer
      for as the most dashing adventuress could desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands without speaking. She made room for Philip and his
      luggage amidst the loud indignation of the unsuccessful driver, whom it
      required the combined eloquence of the station-master and the station
      beggar to confute. The silence was prolonged until they started. For three
      days he had been considering what he should do, and still more what he
      should say. He had invented a dozen imaginary conversations, in all of
      which his logic and eloquence procured him certain victory. But how to
      begin? He was in the enemy&rsquo;s country, and everything&mdash;the hot sun,
      the cold air behind the heat, the endless rows of olive-trees, regular yet
      mysterious&mdash;seemed hostile to the placid atmosphere of Sawston in
      which his thoughts took birth. At the outset he made one great concession.
      If the match was really suitable, and Lilia were bent on it, he would give
      in, and trust to his influence with his mother to set things right. He
      would not have made the concession in England; but here in Italy, Lilia,
      however wilful and silly, was at all events growing to be a human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we to talk it over now?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, please,&rdquo; said Miss Abbott, in great agitation. &ldquo;If you will be
      so very kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how long has she been engaged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face was that of a perfect fool&mdash;a fool in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A short time&mdash;quite a short time,&rdquo; she stammered, as if the
      shortness of the time would reassure him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to know how long, if you can remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She entered into elaborate calculations on her fingers. &ldquo;Exactly eleven
      days,&rdquo; she said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you been here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      More calculations, while he tapped irritably with his foot. &ldquo;Close on
      three weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know him before you came?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A native of the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The second silence took place. They had left the plain now and were
      climbing up the outposts of the hills, the olive-trees still accompanying.
      The driver, a jolly fat man, had got out to ease the horses, and was
      walking by the side of the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understood they met at the hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a mistake of Mrs. Theobald&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I also understand that he is a member of the Italian nobility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I be told his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Abbott whispered, &ldquo;Carella.&rdquo; But the driver heard her, and a grin
      split over his face. The engagement must be known already.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carella? Conte or Marchese, or what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signor,&rdquo; said Miss Abbott, and looked helplessly aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I bore you with these questions. If so, I will stop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, please; not at all. I am here&mdash;my own idea&mdash;to give all
      information which you very naturally&mdash;and to see if somehow&mdash;please
      ask anything you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how old is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, quite young. Twenty-one, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There burst from Philip the exclamation, &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would never believe it,&rdquo; said Miss Abbott, flushing. &ldquo;He looks much
      older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is he good-looking?&rdquo; he asked, with gathering sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She became decisive. &ldquo;Very good-looking. All his features are good, and he
      is well built&mdash;though I dare say English standards would find him too
      short.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip, whose one physical advantage was his height, felt annoyed at her
      implied indifference to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I conclude that you like him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She replied decisively again, &ldquo;As far as I have seen him, I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the carriage entered a little wood, which lay brown and
      sombre across the cultivated hill. The trees of the wood were small and
      leafless, but noticeable for this&mdash;that their stems stood in violets
      as rocks stand in the summer sea. There are such violets in England, but
      not so many. Nor are there so many in Art, for no painter has the courage.
      The cart-ruts were channels, the hollow lagoons; even the dry white margin
      of the road was splashed, like a causeway soon to be submerged under the
      advancing tide of spring. Philip paid no attention at the time: he was
      thinking what to say next. But his eyes had registered the beauty, and
      next March he did not forget that the road to Monteriano must traverse
      innumerable flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as I have seen him, I do like him,&rdquo; repeated Miss Abbott, after a
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought she sounded a little defiant, and crushed her at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he, please? You haven&rsquo;t told me that. What&rsquo;s his position?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened her mouth to speak, and no sound came from it. Philip waited
      patiently. She tried to be audacious, and failed pitiably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No position at all. He is kicking his heels, as my father would say. You
      see, he has only just finished his military service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a private?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so. There is general conscription. He was in the Bersaglieri, I
      think. Isn&rsquo;t that the crack regiment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The men in it must be short and broad. They must also be able to walk six
      miles an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him wildly, not understanding all that he said, but feeling
      that he was very clever. Then she continued her defence of Signor Carella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, like most young men, he is looking out for something to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanwhile?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanwhile, like most young men, he lives with his people&mdash;father,
      mother, two sisters, and a tiny tot of a brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a grating sprightliness about her that drove him nearly mad. He
      determined to silence her at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One more question, and only one more. What is his father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His father,&rdquo; said Miss Abbott. &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;ll think it a
      good match. But that&rsquo;s not the point. I mean the point is not&mdash;I mean
      that social differences&mdash;love, after all&mdash;not but what&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip ground his teeth together and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen sometimes judge hardly. But I feel that you, and at all events
      your mother&mdash;so really good in every sense, so really unworldly&mdash;after
      all, love-marriages are made in heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss Abbott, I know. But I am anxious to hear heaven&rsquo;s choice. You
      arouse my curiosity. Is my sister-in-law to marry an angel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Herriton, don&rsquo;t&mdash;please, Mr. Herriton&mdash;a dentist. His
      father&rsquo;s a dentist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip gave a cry of personal disgust and pain. He shuddered all over, and
      edged away from his companion. A dentist! A dentist at Monteriano. A
      dentist in fairyland! False teeth and laughing gas and the tilting chair
      at a place which knew the Etruscan League, and the Pax Romana, and Alaric
      himself, and the Countess Matilda, and the Middle Ages, all fighting and
      holiness, and the Renaissance, all fighting and beauty! He thought of
      Lilia no longer. He was anxious for himself: he feared that Romance might
      die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Romance only dies with life. No pair of pincers will ever pull it out of
      us. But there is a spurious sentiment which cannot resist the unexpected
      and the incongruous and the grotesque. A touch will loosen it, and the
      sooner it goes from us the better. It was going from Philip now, and
      therefore he gave the cry of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot think what is in the air,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;If Lilia was determined to
      disgrace us, she might have found a less repulsive way. A boy of medium
      height with a pretty face, the son of a dentist at Monteriano. Have I put
      it correctly? May I surmise that he has not got one penny? May I also
      surmise that his social position is nil? Furthermore&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! I&rsquo;ll tell you no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Miss Abbott, it is a little late for reticence. You have equipped
      me admirably!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you not another word!&rdquo; she cried, with a spasm of terror. Then
      she got out her handkerchief, and seemed as if she would shed tears. After
      a silence, which he intended to symbolize to her the dropping of a curtain
      on the scene, he began to talk of other subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were among olives again, and the wood with its beauty and wildness
      had passed away. But as they climbed higher the country opened out, and
      there appeared, high on a hill to the right, Monteriano. The hazy green of
      the olives rose up to its walls, and it seemed to float in isolation
      between trees and sky, like some fantastic ship city of a dream. Its
      colour was brown, and it revealed not a single house&mdash;nothing but the
      narrow circle of the walls, and behind them seventeen towers&mdash;all
      that was left of the fifty-two that had filled the city in her prime. Some
      were only stumps, some were inclining stiffly to their fall, some were
      still erect, piercing like masts into the blue. It was impossible to
      praise it as beautiful, but it was also impossible to damn it as quaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Philip talked continually, thinking this to be great evidence of
      resource and tact. It showed Miss Abbott that he had probed her to the
      bottom, but was able to conquer his disgust, and by sheer force of
      intellect continue to be as agreeable and amusing as ever. He did not know
      that he talked a good deal of nonsense, and that the sheer force of his
      intellect was weakened by the sight of Monteriano, and by the thought of
      dentistry within those walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town above them swung to the left, to the right, to the left again, as
      the road wound upward through the trees, and the towers began to glow in
      the descending sun. As they drew near, Philip saw the heads of people
      gathering black upon the walls, and he knew well what was happening&mdash;how
      the news was spreading that a stranger was in sight, and the beggars were
      aroused from their content and bid to adjust their deformities; how the
      alabaster man was running for his wares, and the Authorized Guide running
      for his peaked cap and his two cards of recommendation&mdash;one from Miss
      M&rsquo;Gee, Maida Vale, the other, less valuable, from an Equerry to the Queen
      of Peru; how some one else was running to tell the landlady of the Stella
      d&rsquo;Italia to put on her pearl necklace and brown boots and empty the slops
      from the spare bedroom; and how the landlady was running to tell Lilia and
      her boy that their fate was at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was a pity Philip had talked so profusely. He had driven Miss
      Abbott half demented, but he had given himself no time to concert a plan.
      The end came so suddenly. They emerged from the trees on to the terrace
      before the walk, with the vision of half Tuscany radiant in the sun behind
      them, and then they turned in through the Siena gate, and their journey
      was over. The Dogana men admitted them with an air of gracious welcome,
      and they clattered up the narrow dark street, greeted by that mixture of
      curiosity and kindness which makes each Italian arrival so wonderful.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was stunned and knew not what to do. At the hotel he received no
      ordinary reception. The landlady wrung him by the hand; one person
      snatched his umbrella, another his bag; people pushed each other out of
      his way. The entrance seemed blocked with a crowd. Dogs were barking,
      bladder whistles being blown, women waving their handkerchiefs, excited
      children screaming on the stairs, and at the top of the stairs was Lilia
      herself, very radiant, with her best blouse on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Welcome to Monteriano!&rdquo; He greeted her, for he did
      not know what else to do, and a sympathetic murmur rose from the crowd
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me to come here,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t forget it. Let me
      introduce Signor Carella!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip discerned in the corner behind her a young man who might eventually
      prove handsome and well-made, but certainly did not seem so then. He was
      half enveloped in the drapery of a cold dirty curtain, and nervously stuck
      out a hand, which Philip took and found thick and damp. There were more
      murmurs of approval from the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, din-din&rsquo;s nearly ready,&rdquo; said Lilia. &ldquo;Your room&rsquo;s down the passage,
      Philip. You needn&rsquo;t go changing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stumbled away to wash his hands, utterly crushed by her effrontery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Caroline!&rdquo; whispered Lilia as soon as he had gone. &ldquo;What an angel
      you&rsquo;ve been to tell him! He takes it so well. But you must have had a
      MAUVAIS QUART D&rsquo;HEURE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Abbott&rsquo;s long terror suddenly turned into acidity. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told
      nothing,&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all for you&mdash;and if it only takes a
      quarter of an hour you&rsquo;ll be lucky!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was a nightmare. They had the smelly dining-room to themselves.
      Lilia, very smart and vociferous, was at the head of the table; Miss
      Abbott, also in her best, sat by Philip, looking, to his irritated nerves,
      more like the tragedy confidante every moment. That scion of the Italian
      nobility, Signor Carella, sat opposite. Behind him loomed a bowl of
      goldfish, who swam round and round, gaping at the guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The face of Signor Carella was twitching too much for Philip to study it.
      But he could see the hands, which were not particularly clean, and did not
      get cleaner by fidgeting amongst the shining slabs of hair. His starched
      cuffs were not clean either, and as for his suit, it had obviously been
      bought for the occasion as something really English&mdash;a gigantic
      check, which did not even fit. His handkerchief he had forgotten, but
      never missed it. Altogether, he was quite unpresentable, and very lucky to
      have a father who was a dentist in Monteriano. And why, even Lilia&mdash;But
      as soon as the meal began it furnished Philip with an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the youth was hungry, and his lady filled his plate with spaghetti,
      and when those delicious slippery worms were flying down his throat, his
      face relaxed and became for a moment unconscious and calm. And Philip had
      seen that face before in Italy a hundred times&mdash;seen it and loved it,
      for it was not merely beautiful, but had the charm which is the rightful
      heritage of all who are born on that soil. But he did not want to see it
      opposite him at dinner. It was not the face of a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversation, to give it that name, was carried on in a mixture of English
      and Italian. Lilia had picked up hardly any of the latter language, and
      Signor Carella had not yet learnt any of the former. Occasionally Miss
      Abbott had to act as interpreter between the lovers, and the situation
      became uncouth and revolting in the extreme. Yet Philip was too cowardly
      to break forth and denounce the engagement. He thought he should be more
      effective with Lilia if he had her alone, and pretended to himself that he
      must hear her defence before giving judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Signor Carella, heartened by the spaghetti and the throat-rasping wine,
      attempted to talk, and, looking politely towards Philip, said, &ldquo;England is
      a great country. The Italians love England and the English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip, in no mood for international amenities, merely bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Italy too,&rdquo; the other continued a little resentfully, &ldquo;is a great
      country. She has produced many famous men&mdash;for example Garibaldi and
      Dante. The latter wrote the &lsquo;Inferno,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Purgatorio,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Paradiso.&rsquo; 
      The &lsquo;Inferno&rsquo; is the most beautiful.&rdquo; And with the complacent tone of one
      who has received a solid education, he quoted the opening lines&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita
  Mi ritrovai per una selva oscura
  Che la diritta via era smarrita&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      a quotation which was more apt than he supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilia glanced at Philip to see whether he noticed that she was marrying no
      ignoramus. Anxious to exhibit all the good qualities of her betrothed, she
      abruptly introduced the subject of pallone, in which, it appeared, he was
      a proficient player. He suddenly became shy and developed a conceited grin&mdash;the
      grin of the village yokel whose cricket score is mentioned before a
      stranger. Philip himself had loved to watch pallone, that entrancing
      combination of lawn-tennis and fives. But he did not expect to love it
      quite so much again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, look!&rdquo; exclaimed Lilia, &ldquo;the poor wee fish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A starved cat had been worrying them all for pieces of the purple
      quivering beef they were trying to swallow. Signor Carella, with the
      brutality so common in Italians, had caught her by the paw and flung her
      away from him. Now she had climbed up to the bowl and was trying to hook
      out the fish. He got up, drove her off, and finding a large glass stopper
      by the bowl, entirely plugged up the aperture with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But may not the fish die?&rdquo; said Miss Abbott. &ldquo;They have no air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fish live on water, not on air,&rdquo; he replied in a knowing voice, and sat
      down. Apparently he was at his ease again, for he took to spitting on the
      floor. Philip glanced at Lilia but did not detect her wincing. She talked
      bravely till the end of the disgusting meal, and then got up saying,
      &ldquo;Well, Philip, I am sure you are ready for by-bye. We shall meet at twelve
      o&rsquo;clock lunch tomorrow, if we don&rsquo;t meet before. They give us caffe later
      in our rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a little too impudent. Philip replied, &ldquo;I should like to see you
      now, please, in my room, as I have come all the way on business.&rdquo; He heard
      Miss Abbott gasp. Signor Carella, who was lighting a rank cigar, had not
      understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as he expected. When he was alone with Lilia he lost all
      nervousness. The remembrance of his long intellectual supremacy
      strengthened him, and he began volubly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Lilia, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s have a scene. Before I arrived I thought I
      might have to question you. It is unnecessary. I know everything. Miss
      Abbott has told me a certain amount, and the rest I see for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See for yourself?&rdquo; she exclaimed, and he remembered afterwards that she
      had flushed crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he is probably a ruffian and certainly a cad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no cads in Italy,&rdquo; she said quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was taken aback. It was one of his own remarks. And she further upset
      him by adding, &ldquo;He is the son of a dentist. Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for the information. I know everything, as I told you before. I
      am also aware of the social position of an Italian who pulls teeth in a
      minute provincial town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was not aware of it, but he ventured to conclude that it was pretty,
      low. Nor did Lilia contradict him. But she was sharp enough to say,
      &ldquo;Indeed, Philip, you surprise me. I understood you went in for equality
      and so on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I understood that Signor Carella was a member of the Italian
      nobility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we put it like that in the telegram so as not to shock dear Mrs.
      Herriton. But it is true. He is a younger branch. Of course families
      ramify&mdash;just as in yours there is your cousin Joseph.&rdquo; She adroitly
      picked out the only undesirable member of the Herriton clan. &ldquo;Gino&rsquo;s
      father is courtesy itself, and rising rapidly in his profession. This very
      month he leaves Monteriano, and sets up at Poggibonsi. And for my own poor
      part, I think what people are is what matters, but I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;ll
      agree. And I should like you to know that Gino&rsquo;s uncle is a priest&mdash;the
      same as a clergyman at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip was aware of the social position of an Italian priest, and said so
      much about it that Lilia interrupted him with, &ldquo;Well, his cousin&rsquo;s a
      lawyer at Rome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of &lsquo;lawyer&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, a lawyer just like you are&mdash;except that he has lots to do and
      can never get away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The remark hurt more than he cared to show. He changed his method, and in
      a gentle, conciliating tone delivered the following speech:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole thing is like a bad dream&mdash;so bad that it cannot go on. If
      there was one redeeming feature about the man I might be uneasy. As it is
      I can trust to time. For the moment, Lilia, he has taken you in, but you
      will find him out soon. It is not possible that you, a lady, accustomed to
      ladies and gentlemen, will tolerate a man whose position is&mdash;well,
      not equal to the son of the servants&rsquo; dentist in Coronation Place. I am
      not blaming you now. But I blame the glamour of Italy&mdash;I have felt it
      myself, you know&mdash;and I greatly blame Miss Abbott.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caroline! Why blame her? What&rsquo;s all this to do with Caroline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because we expected her to&mdash;&rdquo; He saw that the answer would involve
      him in difficulties, and, waving his hand, continued, &ldquo;So I am confident,
      and you in your heart agree, that this engagement will not last. Think of
      your life at home&mdash;think of Irma! And I&rsquo;ll also say think of us; for
      you know, Lilia, that we count you more than a relation. I should feel I
      was losing my own sister if you did this, and my mother would lose a
      daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed touched at last, for she turned away her face and said, &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t break it off now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Lilia,&rdquo; said he, genuinely moved. &ldquo;I know it may be painful. But I
      have come to rescue you, and, book-worm though I may be, I am not
      frightened to stand up to a bully. He&rsquo;s merely an insolent boy. He thinks
      he can keep you to your word by threats. He will be different when he sees
      he has a man to deal with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What follows should be prefaced with some simile&mdash;the simile of a
      powder-mine, a thunderbolt, an earthquake&mdash;for it blew Philip up in
      the air and flattened him on the ground and swallowed him up in the
      depths. Lilia turned on her gallant defender and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For once in my life I&rsquo;ll thank you to leave me alone. I&rsquo;ll thank your
      mother too. For twelve years you&rsquo;ve trained me and tortured me, and I&rsquo;ll
      stand it no more. Do you think I&rsquo;m a fool? Do you think I never felt? Ah!
      when I came to your house a poor young bride, how you all looked me over&mdash;never
      a kind word&mdash;and discussed me, and thought I might just do; and your
      mother corrected me, and your sister snubbed me, and you said funny things
      about me to show how clever you were! And when Charles died I was still to
      run in strings for the honour of your beastly family, and I was to be
      cooped up at Sawston and learn to keep house, and all my chances spoilt of
      marrying again. No, thank you! No, thank you! &lsquo;Bully?&rsquo; &lsquo;Insolent boy?&rsquo; 
      Who&rsquo;s that, pray, but you? But, thank goodness, I can stand up against the
      world now, for I&rsquo;ve found Gino, and this time I marry for love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The coarseness and truth of her attack alike overwhelmed him. But her
      supreme insolence found him words, and he too burst forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! and I forbid you to do it! You despise me, perhaps, and think I&rsquo;m
      feeble. But you&rsquo;re mistaken. You are ungrateful and impertinent and
      contemptible, but I will save you in order to save Irma and our name.
      There is going to be such a row in this town that you and he&rsquo;ll be sorry
      you came to it. I shall shrink from nothing, for my blood is up. It is
      unwise of you to laugh. I forbid you to marry Carella, and I shall tell
      him so now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Tell him so now. Have it out with him. Gino! Gino! Come
      in! Avanti! Fra Filippo forbids the banns!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gino appeared so quickly that he must have been listening outside the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fra Filippo&rsquo;s blood&rsquo;s up. He shrinks from nothing. Oh, take care he
      doesn&rsquo;t hurt you!&rdquo; She swayed about in vulgar imitation of Philip&rsquo;s walk,
      and then, with a proud glance at the square shoulders of her betrothed,
      flounced out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did she intend them to fight? Philip had no intention of doing so; and no
      more, it seemed, had Gino, who stood nervously in the middle of the room
      with twitching lips and eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please sit down, Signor Carella,&rdquo; said Philip in Italian. &ldquo;Mrs. Herriton
      is rather agitated, but there is no reason we should not be calm. Might I
      offer you a cigarette? Please sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He refused the cigarette and the chair, and remained standing in the full
      glare of the lamp. Philip, not averse to such assistance, got his own face
      into shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time he was silent. It might impress Gino, and it also gave him
      time to collect himself. He would not this time fall into the error of
      blustering, which he had caught so unaccountably from Lilia. He would make
      his power felt by restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, when he looked up to begin, was Gino convulsed with silent laughter?
      It vanished immediately; but he became nervous, and was even more pompous
      than he intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signor Carella, I will be frank with you. I have come to prevent you
      marrying Mrs. Herriton, because I see you will both be unhappy together.
      She is English, you are Italian; she is accustomed to one thing, you to
      another. And&mdash;pardon me if I say it&mdash;she is rich and you are
      poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not marrying her because she is rich,&rdquo; was the sulky reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never suggested that for a moment,&rdquo; said Philip courteously. &ldquo;You are
      honourable, I am sure; but are you wise? And let me remind you that we
      want her with us at home. Her little daughter will be motherless, our home
      will be broken up. If you grant my request you will earn our thanks&mdash;and
      you will not be without a reward for your disappointment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reward&mdash;what reward?&rdquo; He bent over the back of a chair and looked
      earnestly at Philip. They were coming to terms pretty quickly. Poor Lilia!
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip said slowly, &ldquo;What about a thousand lire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His soul went forth into one exclamation, and then he was silent, with
      gaping lips. Philip would have given double: he had expected a bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can have them tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found words, and said, &ldquo;It is too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&mdash;&rdquo; His voice broke. Philip watched his face,&mdash;a face
      without refinement perhaps, but not without expression,&mdash;watched it
      quiver and re-form and dissolve from emotion into emotion. There was
      avarice at one moment, and insolence, and politeness, and stupidity, and
      cunning&mdash;and let us hope that sometimes there was love. But gradually
      one emotion dominated, the most unexpected of all; for his chest began to
      heave and his eyes to wink and his mouth to twitch, and suddenly he stood
      erect and roared forth his whole being in one tremendous laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip sprang up, and Gino, who had flung wide his arms to let the
      glorious creature go, took him by the shoulders and shook him, and said,
      &ldquo;Because we are married&mdash;married&mdash;married as soon as I knew you
      were, coming. There was no time to tell you. Oh. oh! You have come all the
      way for nothing. Oh! And oh, your generosity!&rdquo; Suddenly he became grave,
      and said, &ldquo;Please pardon me; I am rude. I am no better than a peasant, and
      I&mdash;&rdquo; Here he saw Philip&rsquo;s face, and it was too much for him. He
      gasped and exploded and crammed his hands into his mouth and spat them out
      in another explosion, and gave Philip an aimless push, which toppled him
      on to the bed. He uttered a horrified Oh! and then gave up, and bolted
      away down the passage, shrieking like a child, to tell the joke to his
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time Philip lay on the bed, pretending to himself that he was hurt
      grievously. He could scarcely see for temper, and in the passage he ran
      against Miss Abbott, who promptly burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sleep at the Globo,&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;and start for Sawston tomorrow
      morning early. He has assaulted me. I could prosecute him. But shall not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop here,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t stop here. You will have to
      take me with you!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter 3
    </h2>
    <p>
      Opposite the Volterra gate of Monteriano, outside the city, is a very
      respectable white-washed mud wall, with a coping of red crinkled tiles to
      keep it from dissolution. It would suggest a gentleman&rsquo;s garden if there
      was not in its middle a large hole, which grows larger with every
      rain-storm. Through the hole is visible, firstly, the iron gate that is
      intended to close it; secondly, a square piece of ground which, though not
      quite, mud, is at the same time not exactly grass; and finally, another
      wall, stone this time, which has a wooden door in the middle and two
      wooden-shuttered windows each side, and apparently forms the facade of a
      one-storey house.
    </p>
    <p>
      This house is bigger than it looks, for it slides for two storeys down the
      hill behind, and the wooden door, which is always locked, really leads
      into the attic. The knowing person prefers to follow the precipitous
      mule-track round the turn of the mud wall till he can take the edifice in
      the rear. Then&mdash;being now on a level with the cellars&mdash;he lifts
      up his head and shouts. If his voice sounds like something light&mdash;a
      letter, for example, or some vegetables, or a bunch of flowers&mdash;a
      basket is let out of the first-floor windows by a string, into which he
      puts his burdens and departs. But if he sounds like something heavy, such
      as a log of wood, or a piece of meat, or a visitor, he is interrogated,
      and then bidden or forbidden to ascend. The ground floor and the upper
      floor of that battered house are alike deserted, and the inmates keep the
      central portion, just as in a dying body all life retires to the heart.
      There is a door at the top of the first flight of stairs, and if the
      visitor is admitted he will find a welcome which is not necessarily cold.
      There are several rooms, some dark and mostly stuffy&mdash;a
      reception-room adorned with horsehair chairs, wool-work stools, and a
      stove that is never lit&mdash;German bad taste without German domesticity
      broods over that room; also a living-room, which insensibly glides into a
      bedroom when the refining influence of hospitality is absent, and real
      bedrooms; and last, but not least, the loggia, where you can live day and
      night if you feel inclined, drinking vermouth and smoking cigarettes, with
      leagues of olive-trees and vineyards and blue-green hills to watch you.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in this house that the brief and inevitable tragedy of Lilia&rsquo;s
      married life took place. She made Gino buy it for her, because it was
      there she had first seen him sitting on the mud wall that faced the
      Volterra gate. She remembered how the evening sun had struck his hair, and
      how he had smiled down at her, and being both sentimental and unrefined,
      was determined to have the man and the place together. Things in Italy are
      cheap for an Italian, and, though he would have preferred a house in the
      piazza, or better still a house at Siena, or, bliss above bliss, a house
      at Leghorn, he did as she asked, thinking that perhaps she showed her good
      taste in preferring so retired an abode.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was far too big for them, and there was a general concourse of
      his relatives to fill it up. His father wished to make it a patriarchal
      concern, where all the family should have their rooms and meet together
      for meals, and was perfectly willing to give up the new practice at
      Poggibonsi and preside. Gino was quite willing too, for he was an
      affectionate youth who liked a large home-circle, and he told it as a
      pleasant bit of news to Lilia, who did not attempt to conceal her horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once he was horrified too; saw that the idea was monstrous; abused
      himself to her for having suggested it; rushed off to tell his father that
      it was impossible. His father complained that prosperity was already
      corrupting him and making him unsympathetic and hard; his mother cried;
      his sisters accused him of blocking their social advance. He was
      apologetic, and even cringing, until they turned on Lilia. Then he turned
      on them, saying that they could not understand, much less associate with,
      the English lady who was his wife; that there should be one master in that
      house&mdash;himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilia praised and petted him on his return, calling him brave and a hero
      and other endearing epithets. But he was rather blue when his clan left
      Monteriano in much dignity&mdash;a dignity which was not at all impaired
      by the acceptance of a cheque. They took the cheque not to Poggibonsi,
      after all, but to Empoli&mdash;a lively, dusty town some twenty miles off.
      There they settled down in comfort, and the sisters said they had been
      driven to it by Gino.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cheque was, of course, Lilia&rsquo;s, who was extremely generous, and was
      quite willing to know anybody so long as she had not to live with them,
      relations-in-law being on her nerves. She liked nothing better than
      finding out some obscure and distant connection&mdash;there were several
      of them&mdash;and acting the lady bountiful, leaving behind her
      bewilderment, and too often discontent. Gino wondered how it was that all
      his people, who had formerly seemed so pleasant, had suddenly become
      plaintive and disagreeable. He put it down to his lady wife&rsquo;s
      magnificence, in comparison with which all seemed common. Her money flew
      apace, in spite of the cheap living. She was even richer than he expected;
      and he remembered with shame how he had once regretted his inability to
      accept the thousand lire that Philip Herriton offered him in exchange for
      her. It would have been a shortsighted bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilia enjoyed settling into the house, with nothing to do except give
      orders to smiling workpeople, and a devoted husband as interpreter. She
      wrote a jaunty account of her happiness to Mrs. Herriton, and Harriet
      answered the letter, saying (1) that all future communications should be
      addressed to the solicitors; (2) would Lilia return an inlaid box which
      Harriet had lent her&mdash;but not given&mdash;to keep handkerchiefs and
      collars in?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look what I am giving up to live with you!&rdquo; she said to Gino, never
      omitting to lay stress on her condescension. He took her to mean the
      inlaid box, and said that she need not give it up at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly fellow, no! I mean the life. Those Herritons are very well
      connected. They lead Sawston society. But what do I care, so long as I
      have my silly fellow!&rdquo; She always treated him as a boy, which he was, and
      as a fool, which he was not, thinking herself so immeasurably superior to
      him that she neglected opportunity after opportunity of establishing her
      rule. He was good-looking and indolent; therefore he must be stupid. He
      was poor; therefore he would never dare to criticize his benefactress. He
      was passionately in love with her; therefore she could do exactly as she
      liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It mayn&rsquo;t be heaven below,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s better than Charles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And all the time the boy was watching her, and growing up.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was reminded of Charles by a disagreeable letter from the solicitors,
      bidding her disgorge a large sum of money for Irma, in accordance with her
      late husband&rsquo;s will. It was just like Charles&rsquo;s suspicious nature to have
      provided against a second marriage. Gino was equally indignant, and
      between them they composed a stinging reply, which had no effect. He then
      said that Irma had better come out and live with them. &ldquo;The air is good,
      so is the food; she will be happy here, and we shall not have to part with
      the money.&rdquo; But Lilia had not the courage even to suggest this to the
      Herritons, and an unexpected terror seized her at the thought of Irma or
      any English child being educated at Monteriano.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gino became terribly depressed over the solicitors&rsquo; letter, more depressed
      than she thought necessary. There was no more to do in the house, and he
      spent whole days in the loggia leaning over the parapet or sitting astride
      it disconsolately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you idle boy!&rdquo; she cried, pinching his muscles. &ldquo;Go and play
      pallone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a married man,&rdquo; he answered, without raising his head. &ldquo;I do not
      play games any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and see your friends then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no friends now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly, silly, silly! You can&rsquo;t stop indoors all day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see no one but you.&rdquo; He spat on to an olive-tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Gino, don&rsquo;t be silly. Go and see your friends, and bring them to see
      me. We both of us like society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked puzzled, but allowed himself to be persuaded, went out, found
      that he was not as friendless as he supposed, and returned after several
      hours in altered spirits. Lilia congratulated herself on her good
      management.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready, too, for people now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I mean to wake you all up,
      just as I woke up Sawston. Let&rsquo;s have plenty of men&mdash;and make them
      bring their womenkind. I mean to have real English tea-parties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is my aunt and her husband; but I thought you did not want to
      receive my relatives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never said such a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you would be right,&rdquo; he said earnestly. &ldquo;They are not for you. Many
      of them are in trade, and even we are little more; you should have
      gentlefolk and nobility for your friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow,&rdquo; thought Lilia. &ldquo;It is sad for him to discover that his
      people are vulgar.&rdquo; She began to tell him that she loved him just for his
      silly self, and he flushed and began tugging at his moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But besides your relatives I must have other people here. Your friends
      have wives and sisters, haven&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; but of course I scarcely know them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not know your friends&rsquo; people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no. If they are poor and have to work for their living I may see
      them&mdash;but not otherwise. Except&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped. The chief
      exception was a young lady, to whom he had once been introduced for
      matrimonial purposes. But the dowry had proved inadequate, and the
      acquaintance terminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How funny! But I mean to change all that. Bring your friends to see me,
      and I will make them bring their people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her rather hopelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, who are the principal people here? Who leads society?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The governor of the prison, he supposed, and the officers who assisted
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, are they married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There we are. Do you know them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;in a way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she exclaimed angrily. &ldquo;They look down on you, do they, poor boy?
      Wait!&rdquo; He assented. &ldquo;Wait! I&rsquo;ll soon stop that. Now, who else is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The marchese, sometimes, and the canons of the Collegiate Church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The canons&mdash;&rdquo; he began with twinkling eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I forgot your horrid celibacy. In England they would be the centre of
      everything. But why shouldn&rsquo;t I know them? Would it make it easier if I
      called all round? Isn&rsquo;t that your foreign way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not think it would make it easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must know some one! Who were the men you were talking to this
      afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Low-class men. He could scarcely recollect their names.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Gino dear, if they&rsquo;re low class, why did you talk to them? Don&rsquo;t you
      care about your position?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All Gino cared about at present was idleness and pocket-money, and his way
      of expressing it was to exclaim, &ldquo;Ouf-pouf! How hot it is in here. No air;
      I sweat all over. I expire. I must cool myself, or I shall never get to
      sleep.&rdquo; In his funny abrupt way he ran out on to the loggia, where he lay
      full length on the parapet, and began to smoke and spit under the silence
      of the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilia gathered somehow from this conversation that Continental society was
      not the go-as-you-please thing she had expected. Indeed she could not see
      where Continental society was. Italy is such a delightful place to live in
      if you happen to be a man. There one may enjoy that exquisite luxury of
      Socialism&mdash;that true Socialism which is based not on equality of
      income or character, but on the equality of manners. In the democracy of
      the caffe or the street the great question of our life has been solved,
      and the brotherhood of man is a reality. But is accomplished at the
      expense of the sisterhood of women. Why should you not make friends with
      your neighbour at the theatre or in the train, when you know and he knows
      that feminine criticism and feminine insight and feminine prejudice will
      never come between you? Though you become as David and Jonathan, you need
      never enter his home, nor he yours. All your lives you will meet under the
      open air, the only roof-tree of the South, under which he will spit and
      swear, and you will drop your h&rsquo;s, and nobody will think the worse of
      either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the women&mdash;they have, of course, their house and their
      church, with its admirable and frequent services, to which they are
      escorted by the maid. Otherwise they do not go out much, for it is not
      genteel to walk, and you are too poor to keep a carriage. Occasionally you
      will take them to the caffe or theatre, and immediately all your wonted
      acquaintance there desert you, except those few who are expecting and
      expected to marry into your family. It is all very sad. But one
      consolation emerges&mdash;life is very pleasant in Italy if you are a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto Gino had not interfered with Lilia. She was so much older than he
      was, and so much richer, that he regarded her as a superior being who
      answered to other laws. He was not wholly surprised, for strange rumours
      were always blowing over the Alps of lands where men and women had the
      same amusements and interests, and he had often met that privileged
      maniac, the lady tourist, on her solitary walks. Lilia took solitary walks
      too, and only that week a tramp had grabbed at her watch&mdash;an episode
      which is supposed to be indigenous in Italy, though really less frequent
      there than in Bond Street. Now that he knew her better, he was inevitably
      losing his awe: no one could live with her and keep it, especially when
      she had been so silly as to lose a gold watch and chain. As he lay
      thoughtful along the parapet, he realized for the first time the
      responsibilities of monied life. He must save her from dangers, physical
      and social, for after all she was a woman. &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;though
      I am young, am at all events a man, and know what is right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found her still in the living-room, combing her hair, for she had
      something of the slattern in her nature, and there was no need to keep up
      appearances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not go out alone,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;It is not safe. If you want
      to walk, Perfetta shall accompany you.&rdquo; Perfetta was a widowed cousin, too
      humble for social aspirations, who was living with them as factotum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; smiled Lilia, &ldquo;very well&rdquo;&mdash;as if she were addressing a
      solicitous kitten. But for all that she never took a solitary walk again,
      with one exception, till the day of her death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Days passed, and no one called except poor relatives. She began to feel
      dull. Didn&rsquo;t he know the Sindaco or the bank manager? Even the landlady of
      the Stella d&rsquo;Italia would be better than no one. She, when she went into
      the town, was pleasantly received; but people naturally found a difficulty
      in getting on with a lady who could not learn their language. And the
      tea-party, under Gino&rsquo;s adroit management, receded ever and ever before
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a good deal of anxiety over her welfare, for she did not settle
      down in the house at all. But he was comforted by a welcome and unexpected
      visitor. As he was going one afternoon for the letters&mdash;they were
      delivered at the door, but it took longer to get them at the office&mdash;some
      one humorously threw a cloak over his head, and when he disengaged himself
      he saw his very dear friend Spiridione Tesi of the custom-house at
      Chiasso, whom he had not met for two years. What joy! what salutations! so
      that all the passersby smiled with approval on the amiable scene.
      Spiridione&rsquo;s brother was now station-master at Bologna, and thus he
      himself could spend his holiday travelling over Italy at the public
      expense. Hearing of Gino&rsquo;s marriage, he had come to see him on his way to
      Siena, where lived his own uncle, lately monied too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They all do it,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;myself excepted.&rdquo; He was not quite
      twenty-three. &ldquo;But tell me more. She is English. That is good, very good.
      An English wife is very good indeed. And she is rich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immensely rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blonde or dark?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blonde.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It pleases me very much,&rdquo; said Gino simply. &ldquo;If you remember, I always
      desired a blonde.&rdquo; Three or four men had collected, and were listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We all desire one,&rdquo; said Spiridione. &ldquo;But you, Gino, deserve your good
      fortune, for you are a good son, a brave man, and a true friend, and from
      the very first moment I saw you I wished you well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No compliments, I beg,&rdquo; said Gino, standing with his hands crossed on his
      chest and a smile of pleasure on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spiridione addressed the other men, none of whom he had ever seen before.
      &ldquo;Is it not true? Does not he deserve this wealthy blonde?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does deserve her,&rdquo; said all the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a marvellous land, where you love it or hate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no letters, and of course they sat down at the Caffe Garibaldi,
      by the Collegiate Church&mdash;quite a good caffe that for so small a
      city. There were marble-topped tables, and pillars terra-cotta below and
      gold above, and on the ceiling was a fresco of the battle of Solferino.
      One could not have desired a prettier room. They had vermouth and little
      cakes with sugar on the top, which they chose gravely at the counter,
      pinching them first to be sure they were fresh. And though vermouth is
      barely alcoholic, Spiridione drenched his with soda-water to be sure that
      it should not get into his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were in high spirits, and elaborate compliments alternated curiously
      with gentle horseplay. But soon they put up their legs on a pair of chairs
      and began to smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said Spiridione&mdash;&ldquo;I forgot to ask&mdash;is she young?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty-three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, we cannot have everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you would be surprised. Had she told me twenty-eight, I should not
      have disbelieved her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she SIMPATICA?&rdquo; (Nothing will translate that word.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Gino dabbed at the sugar and said after a silence, &ldquo;Sufficiently so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a most important thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is rich, she is generous, she is affable, she addresses her inferiors
      without haughtiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another silence. &ldquo;It is not sufficient,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;One
      does not define it thus.&rdquo; He lowered his voice to a whisper. &ldquo;Last month a
      German was smuggling cigars. The custom-house was dark. Yet I refused
      because I did not like him. The gifts of such men do not bring happiness.
      NON ERA SIMPATICO. He paid for every one, and the fine for deception
      besides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you gain much beyond your pay?&rdquo; asked Gino, diverted for an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not accept small sums now. It is not worth the risk. But the German
      was another matter. But listen, my Gino, for I am older than you and more
      full of experience. The person who understands us at first sight, who
      never irritates us, who never bores, to whom we can pour forth every
      thought and wish, not only in speech but in silence&mdash;that is what I
      mean by SIMPATICO.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are such men, I know,&rdquo; said Gino. &ldquo;And I have heard it said of
      children. But where will you find such a woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true. Here you are wiser than I. SONO POCO SIMPATICHE LE DONNE.
      And the time we waste over them is much.&rdquo; He sighed dolefully, as if he
      found the nobility of his sex a burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One I have seen who may be so. She spoke very little, but she was a young
      lady&mdash;different to most. She, too, was English, the companion of my
      wife here. But Fra Filippo, the brother-in-law, took her back with him. I
      saw them start. He was very angry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he spoke of his exciting and secret marriage, and they made fun of
      the unfortunate Philip, who had travelled over Europe to stop it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret though,&rdquo; said Gino, when they had finished laughing, &ldquo;that I
      toppled him on to the bed. A great tall man! And when I am really amused I
      am often impolite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will never see him again,&rdquo; said Spiridione, who carried plenty of
      philosophy about him. &ldquo;And by now the scene will have passed from his
      mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sometimes happens that such things are recollected longest. I shall
      never see him again, of course; but it is no benefit to me that he should
      wish me ill. And even if he has forgotten, I am still sorry that I toppled
      him on to the bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So their talk continued, at one moment full of childishness and tender
      wisdom, the next moment scandalously gross. The shadows of the terra-cotta
      pillars lengthened, and tourists, flying through the Palazzo Pubblico
      opposite, could observe how the Italians wasted time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of tourists reminded Gino of something he might say. &ldquo;I want to
      consult you since you are so kind as to take an interest in my affairs. My
      wife wishes to take solitary walks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Spiridione was shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have forbidden her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does not yet understand. She asked me to accompany her sometimes&mdash;to
      walk without object! You know, she would like me to be with her all day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. I see.&rdquo; He knitted his brows and tried to think how he could help
      his friend. &ldquo;She needs employment. Is she a Catholic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a pity. She must be persuaded. It will be a great solace to her
      when she is alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a Catholic, but of course I never go to church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. Still, you might take her at first. That is what my
      brother has done with his wife at Bologna and he has joined the Free
      Thinkers. He took her once or twice himself, and now she has acquired the
      habit and continues to go without him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most excellent advice, and I thank you for it. But she wishes to give
      tea-parties&mdash;men and women together whom she has never seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the English! they are always thinking of tea. They carry it by the
      kilogramme in their trunks, and they are so clumsy that they always pack
      it at the top. But it is absurd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to do about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do nothing. Or ask me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; cried Gino, springing up. &ldquo;She will be quite pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dashing young fellow coloured crimson. &ldquo;Of course I was only joking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. But she wants me to take my friends. Come now! Waiter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I do come,&rdquo; cried the other, &ldquo;and take tea with you, this bill must be
      my affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not; you are in my country!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long argument ensued, in which the waiter took part, suggesting various
      solutions. At last Gino triumphed. The bill came to eightpence-halfpenny,
      and a halfpenny for the waiter brought it up to ninepence. Then there was
      a shower of gratitude on one side and of deprecation on the other, and
      when courtesies were at their height they suddenly linked arms and swung
      down the street, tickling each other with lemonade straws as they went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilia was delighted to see them, and became more animated than Gino had
      known her for a long time. The tea tasted of chopped hay, and they asked
      to be allowed to drink it out of a wine-glass, and refused milk; but, as
      she repeatedly observed, this was something like. Spiridione&rsquo;s manners
      were very agreeable. He kissed her hand on introduction, and as his
      profession had taught him a little English, conversation did not flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like music?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Passionately,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I have not studied scientific music, but the
      music of the heart, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she played on the humming piano very badly, and he sang, not so badly.
      Gino got out a guitar and sang too, sitting out on the loggia. It was a
      most agreeable visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gino said he would just walk his friend back to his lodgings. As they went
      he said, without the least trace of malice or satire in his voice, &ldquo;I
      think you are quite right. I shall not bring people to the house any more.
      I do not see why an English wife should be treated differently. This is
      Italy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very wise,&rdquo; exclaimed the other; &ldquo;very wise indeed. The more
      precious a possession the more carefully it should be guarded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had reached the lodging, but went on as far as the Caffe Garibaldi,
      where they spent a long and most delightful evening.

    <h2>
      Chapter 4
    </h2>
    <p>
      The advance of regret can be so gradual that it is impossible to say
      &ldquo;yesterday I was happy, today I am not.&rdquo; At no one moment did Lilia
      realize that her marriage was a failure; yet during the summer and autumn
      she became as unhappy as it was possible for her nature to be. She had no
      unkind treatment, and few unkind words, from her husband. He simply left
      her alone. In the morning he went out to do &ldquo;business,&rdquo; which, as far as
      she could discover, meant sitting in the Farmacia. He usually returned to
      lunch, after which he retired to another room and slept. In the evening he
      grew vigorous again, and took the air on the ramparts, often having his
      dinner out, and seldom returning till midnight or later. There were, of
      course, the times when he was away altogether&mdash;at Empoli, Siena,
      Florence, Bologna&mdash;for he delighted in travel, and seemed to pick up
      friends all over the country. Lilia often heard what a favorite he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to see that she must assert herself, but she could not see how.
      Her self-confidence, which had overthrown Philip, had gradually oozed
      away. If she left the strange house there was the strange little town. If
      she were to disobey her husband and walk in the country, that would be
      stranger still&mdash;vast slopes of olives and vineyards, with chalk-white
      farms, and in the distance other slopes, with more olives and more farms,
      and more little towns outlined against the cloudless sky. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t call
      this country,&rdquo; she would say. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s not as wild as Sawston Park!&rdquo;
       And, indeed, there was scarcely a touch of wildness in it&mdash;some of
      those slopes had been under cultivation for two thousand years. But it was
      terrible and mysterious all the same, and its continued presence made
      Lilia so uncomfortable that she forgot her nature and began to reflect.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reflected chiefly about her marriage. The ceremony had been hasty and
      expensive, and the rites, whatever they were, were not those of the Church
      of England. Lilia had no religion in her; but for hours at a time she
      would be seized with a vulgar fear that she was not &ldquo;married properly,&rdquo;
       and that her social position in the next world might be as obscure as it
      was in this. It might be safer to do the thing thoroughly, and one day she
      took the advice of Spiridione and joined the Roman Catholic Church, or as
      she called it, &ldquo;Santa Deodata&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Gino approved; he, too, thought it
      safer, and it was fun confessing, though the priest was a stupid old man,
      and the whole thing was a good slap in the face for the people at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people at home took the slap very soberly; indeed, there were few left
      for her to give it to. The Herritons were out of the question; they would
      not even let her write to Irma, though Irma was occasionally allowed to
      write to her. Mrs. Theobald was rapidly subsiding into dotage, and, as far
      as she could be definite about anything, had definitely sided with the
      Herritons. And Miss Abbott did likewise. Night after night did Lilia curse
      this false friend, who had agreed with her that the marriage would &ldquo;do,&rdquo;
       and that the Herritons would come round to it, and then, at the first hint
      of opposition, had fled back to England shrieking and distraught. Miss
      Abbott headed the long list of those who should never be written to, and
      who should never be forgiven. Almost the only person who was not on that
      list was Mr. Kingcroft, who had unexpectedly sent an affectionate and
      inquiring letter. He was quite sure never to cross the Channel, and Lilia
      drew freely on her fancy in the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first she had seen a few English people, for Monteriano was not the end
      of the earth. One or two inquisitive ladies, who had heard at home of her
      quarrel with the Herritons, came to call. She was very sprightly, and they
      thought her quite unconventional, and Gino a charming boy, so all that was
      to the good. But by May the season, such as it was, had finished, and
      there would be no one till next spring. As Mrs. Herriton had often
      observed, Lilia had no resources. She did not like music, or reading, or
      work. Her one qualification for life was rather blowsy high spirits, which
      turned querulous or boisterous according to circumstances. She was not
      obedient, but she was cowardly, and in the most gentle way, which Mrs.
      Herriton might have envied, Gino made her do what he wanted. At first it
      had been rather fun to let him get the upper hand. But it was galling to
      discover that he could not do otherwise. He had a good strong will when he
      chose to use it, and would not have had the least scruple in using bolts
      and locks to put it into effect. There was plenty of brutality deep down
      in him, and one day Lilia nearly touched it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the old question of going out alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always do it in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Italy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I&rsquo;m older than you, and I&rsquo;ll settle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am your husband,&rdquo; he said, smiling. They had finished their mid-day
      meal, and he wanted to go and sleep. Nothing would rouse him up, until at
      last Lilia, getting more and more angry, said, &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve got the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked horrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now was the moment to assert herself. She made the statement again. He got
      up from his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;d better mend your manners,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;for you&rsquo;d find it
      awkward if I stopped drawing cheques.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was no reader of character, but she quickly became alarmed. As she
      said to Perfetta afterwards, &ldquo;None of his clothes seemed to fit&mdash;too
      big in one place, too small in another.&rdquo; His figure rather than his face
      altered, the shoulders falling forward till his coat wrinkled across the
      back and pulled away from his wrists. He seemed all arms. He edged round
      the table to where she was sitting, and she sprang away and held the chair
      between them, too frightened to speak or to move. He looked at her with
      round, expressionless eyes, and slowly stretched out his left hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perfetta was heard coming up from the kitchen. It seemed to wake him up,
      and he turned away and went to his room without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; cried Lilia, nearly fainting. &ldquo;He is ill&mdash;ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perfetta looked suspicious when she heard the account. &ldquo;What did you say
      to him?&rdquo; She crossed herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly anything,&rdquo; said Lilia and crossed herself also. Thus did the two
      women pay homage to their outraged male.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was clear to Lilia at last that Gino had married her for money. But he
      had frightened her too much to leave any place for contempt. His return
      was terrifying, for he was frightened too, imploring her pardon, lying at
      her feet, embracing her, murmuring &ldquo;It was not I,&rdquo; striving to define
      things which he did not understand. He stopped in the house for three
      days, positively ill with physical collapse. But for all his suffering he
      had tamed her, and she never threatened to cut off supplies again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he kept her even closer than convention demanded. But he was very
      young, and he could not bear it to be said of him that he did not know how
      to treat a lady&mdash;or to manage a wife. And his own social position was
      uncertain. Even in England a dentist is a troublesome creature, whom
      careful people find difficult to class. He hovers between the professions
      and the trades; he may be only a little lower than the doctors, or he may
      be down among the chemists, or even beneath them. The son of the Italian
      dentist felt this too. For himself nothing mattered; he made friends with
      the people he liked, for he was that glorious invariable creature, a man.
      But his wife should visit nowhere rather than visit wrongly: seclusion was
      both decent and safe. The social ideals of North and South had had their
      brief contention, and this time the South had won.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been well if he had been as strict over his own behaviour as
      he was over hers. But the incongruity never occurred to him for a moment.
      His morality was that of the average Latin, and as he was suddenly placed
      in the position of a gentleman, he did not see why he should not behave as
      such. Of course, had Lilia been different&mdash;had she asserted herself
      and got a grip on his character&mdash;he might possibly&mdash;though not
      probably&mdash;have been made a better husband as well as a better man,
      and at all events he could have adopted the attitude of the Englishman,
      whose standard is higher even when his practice is the same. But had Lilia
      been different she might not have married him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discovery of his infidelity&mdash;which she made by accident&mdash;destroyed
      such remnants of self-satisfaction as her life might yet possess. She
      broke down utterly and sobbed and cried in Perfetta&rsquo;s arms. Perfetta was
      kind and even sympathetic, but cautioned her on no account to speak to
      Gino, who would be furious if he was suspected. And Lilia agreed, partly
      because she was afraid of him, partly because it was, after all, the best
      and most dignified thing to do. She had given up everything for him&mdash;her
      daughter, her relatives, her friends, all the little comforts and luxuries
      of a civilized life&mdash;and even if she had the courage to break away,
      there was no one who would receive her now. The Herritons had been almost
      malignant in their efforts against her, and all her friends had one by one
      fallen off. So it was better to live on humbly, trying not to feel,
      endeavouring by a cheerful demeanour to put things right. &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she
      thought, &ldquo;if I have a child he will be different. I know he wants a son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lilia had achieved pathos despite herself, for there are some situations
      in which vulgarity counts no longer. Not Cordelia nor Imogen more deserves
      our tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      She herself cried frequently, making herself look plain and old, which
      distressed her husband. He was particularly kind to her when he hardly
      ever saw her, and she accepted his kindness without resentment, even with
      gratitude, so docile had she become. She did not hate him, even as she had
      never loved him; with her it was only when she was excited that the
      semblance of either passion arose. People said she was headstrong, but
      really her weak brain left her cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suffering, however, is more independent of temperament, and the wisest of
      women could hardly have suffered more.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Gino, he was quite as boyish as ever, and carried his iniquities
      like a feather. A favourite speech of his was, &ldquo;Ah, one ought to marry!
      Spiridione is wrong; I must persuade him. Not till marriage does one
      realize the pleasures and the possibilities of life.&rdquo; So saying, he would
      take down his felt hat, strike it in the right place as infallibly as a
      German strikes his in the wrong place, and leave her.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, when he had gone out thus, Lilia could stand it no longer. It
      was September. Sawston would be just filling up after the summer holidays.
      People would be running in and out of each other&rsquo;s houses all along the
      road. There were bicycle gymkhanas, and on the 30th Mrs. Herriton would be
      holding the annual bazaar in her garden for the C.M.S. It seemed
      impossible that such a free, happy life could exist. She walked out on to
      the loggia. Moonlight and stars in a soft purple sky. The walls of
      Monteriano should be glorious on such a night as this. But the house faced
      away from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perfetta was banging in the kitchen, and the stairs down led past the
      kitchen door. But the stairs up to the attic&mdash;the stairs no one ever
      used&mdash;opened out of the living-room, and by unlocking the door at the
      top one might slip out to the square terrace above the house, and thus for
      ten minutes walk in freedom and peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key was in the pocket of Gino&rsquo;s best suit&mdash;the English check&mdash;which
      he never wore. The stairs creaked and the key-hole screamed; but Perfetta
      was growing deaf. The walls were beautiful, but as they faced west they
      were in shadow. To see the light upon them she must walk round the town a
      little, till they were caught by the beams of the rising moon. She looked
      anxiously at the house, and started.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was easy walking, for a little path ran all outside the ramparts. The
      few people she met wished her a civil good-night, taking her, in her
      hatless condition, for a peasant. The walls trended round towards the
      moon; and presently she came into its light, and saw all the rough towers
      turn into pillars of silver and black, and the ramparts into cliffs of
      pearl. She had no great sense of beauty, but she was sentimental, and she
      began to cry; for here, where a great cypress interrupted the monotony of
      the girdle of olives, she had sat with Gino one afternoon in March, her
      head upon his shoulder, while Caroline was looking at the view and
      sketching. Round the corner was the Siena gate, from which the road to
      England started, and she could hear the rumble of the diligence which was
      going down to catch the night train to Empoli. The next moment it was upon
      her, for the highroad came towards her a little before it began its long
      zigzag down the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver slackened, and called to her to get in. He did not know who she
      was. He hoped she might be coming to the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Non vengo!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wished her good-night, and turned his horses down the corner. As the
      diligence came round she saw that it was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vengo...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was tremulous, and did not carry. The horses swung off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vengo! Vengo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had begun to sing, and heard nothing. She ran down the road screaming
      to him to stop&mdash;that she was coming; while the distance grew greater
      and the noise of the diligence increased. The man&rsquo;s back was black and
      square against the moon, and if he would but turn for an instant she would
      be saved. She tried to cut off the corner of the zigzag, stumbling over
      the great clods of earth, large and hard as rocks, which lay between the
      eternal olives. She was too late; for, just before she regained the road,
      the thing swept past her, thunderous, ploughing up choking clouds of
      moonlit dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not call any more, for she felt very ill, and fainted; and when
      she revived she was lying in the road, with dust in her eyes, and dust in
      her mouth, and dust down her ears. There is something very terrible in
      dust at night-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;He will be so angry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And without further effort she slowly climbed back to captivity, shaking
      her garments as she went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ill luck pursued her to the end. It was one of the nights when Gino
      happened to come in. He was in the kitchen, swearing and smashing plates,
      while Perfetta, her apron over her head, was weeping violently. At the
      sight of Lilia he turned upon her and poured forth a flood of
      miscellaneous abuse. He was far more angry but much less alarming than he
      had been that day when he edged after her round the table. And Lilia
      gained more courage from her bad conscience than she ever had from her
      good one, for as he spoke she was seized with indignation and feared him
      no longer, and saw him for a cruel, worthless, hypocritical, dissolute
      upstart, and spoke in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perfetta screamed for she told him everything&mdash;all she knew and all
      she thought. He stood with open mouth, all the anger gone out of him,
      feeling ashamed, and an utter fool. He was fairly and rightfully cornered.
      When had a husband so given himself away before? She finished; and he was
      dumb, for she had spoken truly. Then, alas! the absurdity of his own
      position grew upon him, and he laughed&mdash;as he would have laughed at
      the same situation on the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You laugh?&rdquo; stammered Lilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;who could help it? I, who thought you knew and saw
      nothing&mdash;I am tricked&mdash;I am conquered. I give in. Let us talk of
      it no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He touched her on the shoulder like a good comrade, half amused and half
      penitent, and then, murmuring and smiling to himself, ran quietly out of
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perfetta burst into congratulations. &ldquo;What courage you have!&rdquo; she cried;
      &ldquo;and what good fortune! He is angry no longer! He has forgiven you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither Perfetta, nor Gino, nor Lilia herself knew the true reason of all
      the misery that followed. To the end he thought that kindness and a little
      attention would be enough to set things straight. His wife was a very
      ordinary woman, and why should her ideas differ from his own? No one
      realized that more than personalities were engaged; that the struggle was
      national; that generations of ancestors, good, bad, or indifferent, forbad
      the Latin man to be chivalrous to the northern woman, the northern woman
      to forgive the Latin man. All this might have been foreseen: Mrs. Herriton
      foresaw it from the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Lilia prided herself on her high personal standard, and Gino
      simply wondered why she did not come round. He hated discomfort and
      yearned for sympathy, but shrank from mentioning his difficulties in the
      town in case they were put down to his own incompetence. Spiridione was
      told, and replied in a philosophical but not very helpful letter. His
      other great friend, whom he trusted more, was still serving in Eritrea or
      some other desolate outpost. And, besides, what was the good of letters?
      Friends cannot travel through the post.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilia, so similar to her husband in many ways, yearned for comfort and
      sympathy too. The night he laughed at her she wildly took up paper and pen
      and wrote page after page, analysing his character, enumerating his
      iniquities, reporting whole conversations, tracing all the causes and the
      growth of her misery. She was beside herself with passion, and though she
      could hardly think or see, she suddenly attained to magnificence and
      pathos which a practised stylist might have envied. It was written like a
      diary, and not till its conclusion did she realize for whom it was meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Irma, darling Irma, this letter is for you. I almost forgot I have a
      daughter. It will make you unhappy, but I want you to know everything, and
      you cannot learn things too soon. God bless you, my dearest, and save you.
      God bless your miserable mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately Mrs. Herriton was in when the letter arrived. She seized it
      and opened it in her bedroom. Another moment, and Irma&rsquo;s placid childhood
      would have been destroyed for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilia received a brief note from Harriet, again forbidding direct
      communication between mother and daughter, and concluding with formal
      condolences. It nearly drove her mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gently! gently!&rdquo; said her husband. They were sitting together on the
      loggia when the letter arrived. He often sat with her now, watching her
      for hours, puzzled and anxious, but not contrite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo; She went in and tore it up, and then began to write&mdash;a
      very short letter, whose gist was &ldquo;Come and save me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is not good to see your wife crying when she writes&mdash;especially if
      you are conscious that, on the whole, your treatment of her has been
      reasonable and kind. It is not good, when you accidentally look over her
      shoulder, to see that she is writing to a man. Nor should she shake her
      fist at you when she leaves the room, under the impression that you are
      engaged in lighting a cigar and cannot see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilia went to the post herself. But in Italy so many things can be
      arranged. The postman was a friend of Gino&rsquo;s, and Mr. Kingcroft never got
      his letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she gave up hope, became ill, and all through the autumn lay in bed.
      Gino was distracted. She knew why; he wanted a son. He could talk and
      think of nothing else. His one desire was to become the father of a man
      like himself, and it held him with a grip he only partially understood,
      for it was the first great desire, the first great passion of his life.
      Falling in love was a mere physical triviality, like warm sun or cool
      water, beside this divine hope of immortality: &ldquo;I continue.&rdquo; He gave
      candles to Santa Deodata, for he was always religious at a crisis, and
      sometimes he went to her himself and prayed the crude uncouth demands of
      the simple. Impetuously he summoned all his relatives back to bear him
      company in his time of need, and Lilia saw strange faces flitting past her
      in the darkened room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My love!&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;my dearest Lilia! Be calm. I have never loved
      any one but you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She, knowing everything, would only smile gently, too broken by suffering
      to make sarcastic repartees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the child was born he gave her a kiss, and said, &ldquo;I have prayed all
      night for a boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some strangely tender impulse moved her, and she said faintly, &ldquo;You are a
      boy yourself, Gino.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He answered, &ldquo;Then we shall be brothers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lay outside the room with his head against the door like a dog. When
      they came to tell him the glad news they found him half unconscious, and
      his face was wet with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Lilia, some one said to her, &ldquo;It is a beautiful boy!&rdquo; But she had
      died in giving birth to him.

    <h2>
      Chapter 5
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the time of Lilia&rsquo;s death Philip Herriton was just twenty-four years of
      age&mdash;indeed the news reached Sawston on his birthday. He was a tall,
      weakly-built young man, whose clothes had to be judiciously padded on the
      shoulders in order to make him pass muster. His face was plain rather than
      not, and there was a curious mixture in it of good and bad. He had a fine
      forehead and a good large nose, and both observation and sympathy were in
      his eyes. But below the nose and eyes all was confusion, and those people
      who believe that destiny resides in the mouth and chin shook their heads
      when they looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip himself, as a boy, had been keenly conscious of these defects.
      Sometimes when he had been bullied or hustled about at school he would
      retire to his cubicle and examine his features in a looking-glass, and he
      would sigh and say, &ldquo;It is a weak face. I shall never carve a place for
      myself in the world.&rdquo; But as years went on he became either less
      self-conscious or more self-satisfied. The world, he found, made a niche
      for him as it did for every one. Decision of character might come later&mdash;or
      he might have it without knowing. At all events he had got a sense of
      beauty and a sense of humour, two most desirable gifts. The sense of
      beauty developed first. It caused him at the age of twenty to wear
      parti-coloured ties and a squashy hat, to be late for dinner on account of
      the sunset, and to catch art from Burne-Jones to Praxiteles. At twenty-two
      he went to Italy with some cousins, and there he absorbed into one
      aesthetic whole olive-trees, blue sky, frescoes, country inns, saints,
      peasants, mosaics, statues, beggars. He came back with the air of a
      prophet who would either remodel Sawston or reject it. All the energies
      and enthusiasms of a rather friendless life had passed into the
      championship of beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a short time it was over. Nothing had happened either in Sawston or
      within himself. He had shocked half-a-dozen people, squabbled with his
      sister, and bickered with his mother. He concluded that nothing could
      happen, not knowing that human love and love of truth sometimes conquer
      where love of beauty fails.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little disenchanted, a little tired, but aesthetically intact, he
      resumed his placid life, relying more and more on his second gift, the
      gift of humour. If he could not reform the world, he could at all events
      laugh at it, thus attaining at least an intellectual superiority.
      Laughter, he read and believed, was a sign of good moral health, and he
      laughed on contentedly, till Lilia&rsquo;s marriage toppled contentment down for
      ever. Italy, the land of beauty, was ruined for him. She had no power to
      change men and things who dwelt in her. She, too, could produce avarice,
      brutality, stupidity&mdash;and, what was worse, vulgarity. It was on her
      soil and through her influence that a silly woman had married a cad. He
      hated Gino, the betrayer of his life&rsquo;s ideal, and now that the sordid
      tragedy had come, it filled him with pangs, not of sympathy, but of final
      disillusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The disillusion was convenient for Mrs. Herriton, who saw a trying little
      period ahead of her, and was glad to have her family united.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we to go into mourning, do you think?&rdquo; She always asked her
      children&rsquo;s advice where possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet thought that they should. She had been detestable to Lilia while
      she lived, but she always felt that the dead deserve attention and
      sympathy. &ldquo;After all she has suffered. That letter kept me awake for
      nights. The whole thing is like one of those horrible modern plays where
      no one is in &lsquo;the right.&rsquo; But if we have mourning, it will mean telling
      Irma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we must tell Irma!&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said his mother. &ldquo;But I think we can still not tell her about
      Lilia&rsquo;s marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that. And she must have suspected something by now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So one would have supposed. But she never cared for her mother, and
      little girls of nine don&rsquo;t reason clearly. She looks on it as a long
      visit. And it is important, most important, that she should not receive a
      shock. All a child&rsquo;s life depends on the ideal it has of its parents.
      Destroy that and everything goes&mdash;morals, behaviour, everything.
      Absolute trust in some one else is the essence of education. That is why I
      have been so careful about talking of poor Lilia before her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you forget this wretched baby. Waters and Adamson write that there is
      a baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Theobald must be told. But she doesn&rsquo;t count. She is breaking up
      very quickly. She doesn&rsquo;t even see Mr. Kingcroft now. He, thank goodness,
      I hear, has at last consoled himself with someone else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The child must know some time,&rdquo; persisted Philip, who felt a little
      displeased, though he could not tell with what.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The later the better. Every moment she is developing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must say it seems rather hard luck, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On Irma? Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On us, perhaps. We have morals and behaviour also, and I don&rsquo;t think this
      continual secrecy improves them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to twist the thing round to that,&rdquo; said Harriet, rather
      disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course there isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said her mother. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep to the main issue.
      This baby&rsquo;s quite beside the point. Mrs. Theobald will do nothing, and
      it&rsquo;s no concern of ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will make a difference in the money, surely,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear; very little. Poor Charles provided for every kind of
      contingency in his will. The money will come to you and Harriet, as Irma&rsquo;s
      guardians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. Does the Italian get anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will get all hers. But you know what that is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. So those are our tactics&mdash;to tell no one about the baby, not
      even Miss Abbott.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly this is the proper course,&rdquo; said Mrs. Herriton, preferring
      &ldquo;course&rdquo; to &ldquo;tactics&rdquo; for Harriet&rsquo;s sake. &ldquo;And why ever should we tell
      Caroline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was so mixed up in the affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor silly creature. The less she hears about it the better she will be
      pleased. I have come to be very sorry for Caroline. She, if any one, has
      suffered and been penitent. She burst into tears when I told her a little,
      only a little, of that terrible letter. I never saw such genuine remorse.
      We must forgive her and forget. Let the dead bury their dead. We will not
      trouble her with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip saw that his mother was scarcely logical. But there was no
      advantage in saying so. &ldquo;Here beginneth the New Life, then. Do you
      remember, mother, that was what we said when we saw Lilia off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear; but now it is really a New Life, because we are all at accord.
      Then you were still infatuated with Italy. It may be full of beautiful
      pictures and churches, but we cannot judge a country by anything but its
      men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is quite true,&rdquo; he said sadly. And as the tactics were now settled,
      he went out and took an aimless and solitary walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time he came back two important things had happened. Irma had been
      told of her mother&rsquo;s death, and Miss Abbott, who had called for a
      subscription, had been told also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irma had wept loudly, had asked a few sensible questions and a good many
      silly ones, and had been content with evasive answers. Fortunately the
      school prize-giving was at hand, and that, together with the prospect of
      new black clothes, kept her from meditating on the fact that Lilia, who
      had been absent so long, would now be absent for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for Caroline,&rdquo; said Mrs. Herriton, &ldquo;I was almost frightened. She broke
      down utterly. She cried even when she left the house. I comforted her as
      best I could, and I kissed her. It is something that the breach between
      her and ourselves is now entirely healed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she ask no questions&mdash;as to the nature of Lilia&rsquo;s death, I
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did. But she has a mind of extraordinary delicacy. She saw that I was
      reticent, and she did not press me. You see, Philip, I can say to you what
      I could not say before Harriet. Her ideas are so crude. Really we do not
      want it known in Sawston that there is a baby. All peace and comfort would
      be lost if people came inquiring after it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mother knew how to manage him. He agreed enthusiastically. And a few
      days later, when he chanced to travel up to London with Miss Abbott, he
      had all the time the pleasant thrill of one who is better informed. Their
      last journey together had been from Monteriano back across Europe. It had
      been a ghastly journey, and Philip, from the force of association, rather
      expected something ghastly now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was surprised. Miss Abbott, between Sawston and Charing Cross, revealed
      qualities which he had never guessed her to possess. Without being exactly
      original, she did show a commendable intelligence, and though at times she
      was gauche and even uncourtly, he felt that here was a person whom it
      might be well to cultivate.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first she annoyed him. They were talking, of course, about Lilia, when
      she broke the thread of vague commiseration and said abruptly, &ldquo;It is all
      so strange as well as so tragic. And what I did was as strange as
      anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first reference she had ever made to her contemptible
      behaviour. &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over now. Let the dead bury
      their dead. It&rsquo;s fallen out of our lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s why I can talk about it and tell you everything I have always
      wanted to. You thought me stupid and sentimental and wicked and mad, but
      you never really knew how much I was to blame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I never think about it now,&rdquo; said Philip gently. He knew that her
      nature was in the main generous and upright: it was unnecessary for her to
      reveal her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first evening we got to Monteriano,&rdquo; she persisted, &ldquo;Lilia went out
      for a walk alone, saw that Italian in a picturesque position on a wall,
      and fell in love. He was shabbily dressed, and she did not even know he
      was the son of a dentist. I must tell you I was used to this sort of
      thing. Once or twice before I had had to send people about their
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; we counted on you,&rdquo; said Philip, with sudden sharpness. After all,
      if she would reveal her thoughts, she must take the consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you did,&rdquo; she retorted with equal sharpness. &ldquo;Lilia saw him
      several times again, and I knew I ought to interfere. I called her to my
      bedroom one night. She was very frightened, for she knew what it was about
      and how severe I could be. &lsquo;Do you love this man?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;Yes or no?&rsquo; 
      She said &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; And I said, &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you marry him if you think you&rsquo;ll
      be happy?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really&mdash;really,&rdquo; exploded Philip, as exasperated as if the thing had
      happened yesterday. &ldquo;You knew Lilia all your life. Apart from everything
      else&mdash;as if she could choose what could make her happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you ever let her choose?&rdquo; she flashed out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s rude,&rdquo;
       she added, trying to calm herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us rather say unhappily expressed,&rdquo; said Philip, who always adopted a
      dry satirical manner when he was puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to finish. Next morning I found Signor Carella and said the same
      to him. He&mdash;well, he was willing. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the telegram?&rdquo; He looked scornfully out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto her voice had been hard, possibly in self-accusation, possibly in
      defiance. Now it became unmistakably sad. &ldquo;Ah, the telegram! That was
      wrong. Lilia there was more cowardly than I was. We should have told the
      truth. It lost me my nerve, at all events. I came to the station meaning
      to tell you everything then. But we had started with a lie, and I got
      frightened. And at the end, when you left, I got frightened again and came
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you really mean to stop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a time, at all events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would that have suited a newly married pair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have suited them. Lilia needed me. And as for him&mdash;I can&rsquo;t
      help feeling I might have got influence over him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ignorant of these matters,&rdquo; said Philip; &ldquo;but I should have thought
      that would have increased the difficulty of the situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crisp remark was wasted on her. She looked hopelessly at the raw
      over-built country, and said, &ldquo;Well, I have explained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But pardon me, Miss Abbott; of most of your conduct you have given a
      description rather than an explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had fairly caught her, and expected that she would gape and collapse.
      To his surprise she answered with some spirit, &ldquo;An explanation may bore
      you, Mr. Herriton: it drags in other topics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hated Sawston, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was delighted. &ldquo;So did and do I. That&rsquo;s splendid. Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hated the idleness, the stupidity, the respectability, the petty
      unselfishness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Petty selfishness,&rdquo; he corrected. Sawston psychology had long been his
      specialty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Petty unselfishness,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I had got an idea that every one
      here spent their lives in making little sacrifices for objects they didn&rsquo;t
      care for, to please people they didn&rsquo;t love; that they never learnt to be
      sincere&mdash;and, what&rsquo;s as bad, never learnt how to enjoy themselves.
      That&rsquo;s what I thought&mdash;what I thought at Monteriano.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Miss Abbott,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you should have told me this before! Think
      it still! I agree with lots of it. Magnificent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now Lilia,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;though there were things about her I didn&rsquo;t
      like, had somehow kept the power of enjoying herself with sincerity. And
      Gino, I thought, was splendid, and young, and strong not only in body, and
      sincere as the day. If they wanted to marry, why shouldn&rsquo;t they do so? Why
      shouldn&rsquo;t she break with the deadening life where she had got into a
      groove, and would go on in it, getting more and more&mdash;worse than
      unhappy&mdash;apathetic till she died? Of course I was wrong. She only
      changed one groove for another&mdash;a worse groove. And as for him&mdash;well,
      you know more about him than I do. I can never trust myself to judge
      characters again. But I still feel he cannot have been quite bad when we
      first met him. Lilia&mdash;that I should dare to say it!&mdash;must have
      been cowardly. He was only a boy&mdash;just going to turn into something
      fine, I thought&mdash;and she must have mismanaged him. So that is the one
      time I have gone against what is proper, and there are the results. You
      have an explanation now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And much of it has been most interesting, though I don&rsquo;t understand
      everything. Did you never think of the disparity of their social
      position?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were mad&mdash;drunk with rebellion. We had no common-sense. As soon
      as you came, you saw and foresaw everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think that.&rdquo; He was vaguely displeased at being credited with
      common-sense. For a moment Miss Abbott had seemed to him more
      unconventional than himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you see,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;why I have troubled you with this long
      story. Women&mdash;I heard you say the other day&mdash;are never at ease
      till they tell their faults out loud. Lilia is dead and her husband gone
      to the bad&mdash;all through me. You see, Mr. Herriton, it makes me
      specially unhappy; it&rsquo;s the only time I&rsquo;ve ever gone into what my father
      calls &lsquo;real life&rsquo;&mdash;and look what I&rsquo;ve made of it! All that winter I
      seemed to be waking up to beauty and splendour and I don&rsquo;t know what; and
      when the spring came, I wanted to fight against the things I hated&mdash;mediocrity
      and dulness and spitefulness and society. I actually hated society for a
      day or two at Monteriano. I didn&rsquo;t see that all these things are
      invincible, and that if we go against them they will break us to pieces.
      Thank you for listening to so much nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I quite sympathize with what you say,&rdquo; said Philip encouragingly; &ldquo;it
      isn&rsquo;t nonsense, and a year or two ago I should have been saying it too.
      But I feel differently now, and I hope that you also will change. Society
      is invincible&mdash;to a certain degree. But your real life is your own,
      and nothing can touch it. There is no power on earth that can prevent your
      criticizing and despising mediocrity&mdash;nothing that can stop you
      retreating into splendour and beauty&mdash;into the thoughts and beliefs
      that make the real life&mdash;the real you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never had that experience yet. Surely I and my life must be where
      I live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evidently she had the usual feminine incapacity for grasping philosophy.
      But she had developed quite a personality, and he must see more of her.
      &ldquo;There is another great consolation against invincible mediocrity,&rdquo; he
      said&mdash;&ldquo;the meeting a fellow-victim. I hope that this is only the
      first of many discussions that we shall have together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made a suitable reply. The train reached Charing Cross, and they
      parted,&mdash;he to go to a matinee, she to buy petticoats for the
      corpulent poor. Her thoughts wandered as she bought them: the gulf between
      herself and Mr. Herriton, which she had always known to be great, now
      seemed to her immeasurable.
    </p>
    <p>
      These events and conversations took place at Christmas-time. The New Life
      initiated by them lasted some seven months. Then a little incident&mdash;a
      mere little vexatious incident&mdash;brought it to its close.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irma collected picture post-cards, and Mrs. Herriton or Harriet always
      glanced first at all that came, lest the child should get hold of
      something vulgar. On this occasion the subject seemed perfectly
      inoffensive&mdash;a lot of ruined factory chimneys&mdash;and Harriet was
      about to hand it to her niece when her eye was caught by the words on the
      margin. She gave a shriek and flung the card into the grate. Of course no
      fire was alight in July, and Irma only had to run and pick it out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you!&rdquo; screamed her aunt. &ldquo;You wicked girl! Give it here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately Mrs. Herriton was out of the room. Irma, who was not in awe
      of Harriet, danced round the table, reading as she did so, &ldquo;View of the
      superb city of Monteriano&mdash;from your lital brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stupid Harriet caught her, boxed her ears, and tore the post-card into
      fragments. Irma howled with pain, and began shouting indignantly, &ldquo;Who is
      my little brother? Why have I never heard of him before? Grandmamma!
      Grandmamma! Who is my little brother? Who is my&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Herriton swept into the room, saying, &ldquo;Come with me, dear, and I will
      tell you. Now it is time for you to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Irma returned from the interview sobbing, though, as a matter of fact, she
      had learnt very little. But that little took hold of her imagination. She
      had promised secrecy&mdash;she knew not why. But what harm in talking of
      the little brother to those who had heard of him already?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Harriet!&rdquo; she would say. &ldquo;Uncle Phil! Grandmamma! What do you
      suppose my little brother is doing now? Has he begun to play? Do Italian
      babies talk sooner than us, or would he be an English baby born abroad?
      Oh, I do long to see him, and be the first to teach him the Ten
      Commandments and the Catechism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last remark always made Harriet look grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Herriton, &ldquo;Irma is getting too tiresome. She
      forgot poor Lilia soon enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A living brother is more to her than a dead mother,&rdquo; said Philip
      dreamily. &ldquo;She can knit him socks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stopped that. She is bringing him in everywhere. It is most vexatious.
      The other night she asked if she might include him in the people she
      mentions specially in her prayers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I allowed her,&rdquo; she replied coldly. &ldquo;She has a right to mention
      any one she chooses. But I was annoyed with her this morning, and I fear
      that I showed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what happened this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She asked if she could pray for her &lsquo;new father&rsquo;&mdash;for the Italian!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you let her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got up without saying anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have felt just as you did when I wanted to pray for the devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the devil,&rdquo; cried Harriet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Harriet; he is too vulgar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will thank you not to scoff against religion!&rdquo; was Harriet&rsquo;s retort.
      &ldquo;Think of that poor baby. Irma is right to pray for him. What an entrance
      into life for an English child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sister, I can reassure you. Firstly, the beastly baby is Italian.
      Secondly, it was promptly christened at Santa Deodata&rsquo;s, and a powerful
      combination of saints watch over&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, dear. And, Harriet, don&rsquo;t be so serious&mdash;I mean not so
      serious when you are with Irma. She will be worse than ever if she thinks
      we have something to hide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet&rsquo;s conscience could be quite as tiresome as Philip&rsquo;s
      unconventionality. Mrs. Herriton soon made it easy for her daughter to go
      for six weeks to the Tirol. Then she and Philip began to grapple with Irma
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as they had got things a little quiet the beastly baby sent another
      picture post-card&mdash;a comic one, not particularly proper. Irma
      received it while they were out, and all the trouble began again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot think,&rdquo; said Mrs. Herriton, &ldquo;what his motive is in sending
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two years before, Philip would have said that the motive was to give
      pleasure. Now he, like his mother, tried to think of something sinister
      and subtle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose that he guesses the situation&mdash;how anxious we are to
      hush the scandal up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is quite possible. He knows that Irma will worry us about the baby.
      Perhaps he hopes that we shall adopt it to quiet her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hopeful indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the same time he has the chance of corrupting the child&rsquo;s morals.&rdquo; She
      unlocked a drawer, took out the post-card, and regarded it gravely. &ldquo;He
      entreats her to send the baby one,&rdquo; was her next remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She might do it too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told her not to; but we must watch her carefully, without, of course,
      appearing to be suspicious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip was getting to enjoy his mother&rsquo;s diplomacy. He did not think of
      his own morals and behaviour any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s to watch her at school, though? She may bubble out any moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can but trust to our influence,&rdquo; said Mrs. Herriton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irma did bubble out, that very day. She was proof against a single
      post-card, not against two. A new little brother is a valuable sentimental
      asset to a school-girl, and her school was then passing through an acute
      phase of baby-worship. Happy the girl who had her quiver full of them, who
      kissed them when she left home in the morning, who had the right to
      extricate them from mail-carts in the interval, who dangled them at tea
      ere they retired to rest! That one might sing the unwritten song of
      Miriam, blessed above all school-girls, who was allowed to hide her baby
      brother in a squashy place, where none but herself could find him!
    </p>
    <p>
      How could Irma keep silent when pretentious girls spoke of baby cousins
      and baby visitors&mdash;she who had a baby brother, who wrote her
      post-cards through his dear papa? She had promised not to tell about him&mdash;she
      knew not why&mdash;and she told. And one girl told another, and one girl
      told her mother, and the thing was out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is all very sad,&rdquo; Mrs. Herriton kept saying. &ldquo;My daughter-in-law
      made a very unhappy marriage, as I dare say you know. I suppose that the
      child will be educated in Italy. Possibly his grandmother may be doing
      something, but I have not heard of it. I do not expect that she will have
      him over. She disapproves of the father. It is altogether a painful
      business for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was careful only to scold Irma for disobedience&mdash;that eighth
      deadly sin, so convenient to parents and guardians. Harriet would have
      plunged into needless explanations and abuse. The child was ashamed, and
      talked about the baby less. The end of the school year was at hand, and
      she hoped to get another prize. But she also had put her hand to the
      wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was several days before they saw Miss Abbott. Mrs. Herriton had not
      come across her much since the kiss of reconciliation, nor Philip since
      the journey to London. She had, indeed, been rather a disappointment to
      him. Her creditable display of originality had never been repeated: he
      feared she was slipping back. Now she came about the Cottage Hospital&mdash;her
      life was devoted to dull acts of charity&mdash;and though she got money
      out of him and out of his mother, she still sat tight in her chair,
      looking graver and more wooden than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you have heard,&rdquo; said Mrs. Herriton, well knowing what the
      matter was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have. I came to ask you; have any steps been taken?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip was astonished. The question was impertinent in the extreme. He had
      a regard for Miss Abbott, and regretted that she had been guilty of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the baby?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Herriton pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as I know, no steps. Mrs. Theobald may have decided on something,
      but I have not heard of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was meaning, had you decided on anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The child is no relation of ours,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;It is therefore scarcely
      for us to interfere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mother glanced at him nervously. &ldquo;Poor Lilia was almost a daughter to
      me once. I know what Miss Abbott means. But now things have altered. Any
      initiative would naturally come from Mrs. Theobald.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But does not Mrs. Theobald always take any initiative from you?&rdquo; asked
      Miss Abbott.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Herriton could not help colouring. &ldquo;I sometimes have given her advice
      in the past. I should not presume to do so now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then is nothing to be done for the child at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is extraordinarily good of you to take this unexpected interest,&rdquo; said
      Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The child came into the world through my negligence,&rdquo; replied Miss
      Abbott. &ldquo;It is natural I should take an interest in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Caroline,&rdquo; said Mrs. Herriton, &ldquo;you must not brood over the
      thing. Let bygones be bygones. The child should worry you even less than
      it worries us. We never even mention it. It belongs to another world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Abbott got up without replying and turned to go. Her extreme gravity
      made Mrs. Herriton uneasy. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;if Mrs. Theobald
      decides on any plan that seems at all practicable&mdash;I must say I don&rsquo;t
      see any such&mdash;I shall ask if I may join her in it, for Irma&rsquo;s sake,
      and share in any possible expenses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please would you let me know if she decides on anything. I should like to
      join as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, how you throw about your money! We would never allow it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if she decides on nothing, please also let me know. Let me know in
      any case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Herriton made a point of kissing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the young person mad?&rdquo; burst out Philip as soon as she had departed.
      &ldquo;Never in my life have I seen such colossal impertinence. She ought to be
      well smacked, and sent back to Sunday-school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mother said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you see&mdash;she is practically threatening us? You can&rsquo;t put
      her off with Mrs. Theobald; she knows as well as we do that she is a
      nonentity. If we don&rsquo;t do anything she&rsquo;s going to raise a scandal&mdash;that
      we neglect our relatives, &amp;c., which is, of course, a lie. Still
      she&rsquo;ll say it. Oh, dear, sweet, sober Caroline Abbott has a screw loose!
      We knew it at Monteriano. I had my suspicions last year one day in the
      train; and here it is again. The young person is mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She still said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I go round at once and give it her well? I&rsquo;d really enjoy it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a low, serious voice&mdash;such a voice as she had not used to him for
      months&mdash;Mrs. Herriton said, &ldquo;Caroline has been extremely impertinent.
      Yet there may be something in what she says after all. Ought the child to
      grow up in that place&mdash;and with that father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip started and shuddered. He saw that his mother was not sincere. Her
      insincerity to others had amused him, but it was disheartening when used
      against himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us admit frankly,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;that after all we may have
      responsibilities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you, Mother. You are turning absolutely round. What
      are you up to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In one moment an impenetrable barrier had been erected between them. They
      were no longer in smiling confidence. Mrs. Herriton was off on tactics of
      her own&mdash;tactics which might be beyond or beneath him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His remark offended her. &ldquo;Up to? I am wondering whether I ought not to
      adopt the child. Is that sufficiently plain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is the result of half-a-dozen idiocies of Miss Abbott?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is. I repeat, she has been extremely impertinent. None the less she is
      showing me my duty. If I can rescue poor Lilia&rsquo;s baby from that horrible
      man, who will bring it up either as Papist or infidel&mdash;who will
      certainly bring it up to be vicious&mdash;I shall do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk like Harriet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; said she, flushing at what she knew to be an insult. &ldquo;Say,
      if you choose, that I talk like Irma. That child has seen the thing more
      clearly than any of us. She longs for her little brother. She shall have
      him. I don&rsquo;t care if I am impulsive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was sure that she was not impulsive, but did not dare to say so. Her
      ability frightened him. All his life he had been her puppet. She let him
      worship Italy, and reform Sawston&mdash;just as she had let Harriet be Low
      Church. She had let him talk as much as he liked. But when she wanted a
      thing she always got it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And though she was frightening him, she did not inspire him with
      reverence. Her life, he saw, was without meaning. To what purpose was her
      diplomacy, her insincerity, her continued repression of vigour? Did they
      make any one better or happier? Did they even bring happiness to herself?
      Harriet with her gloomy peevish creed, Lilia with her clutches after
      pleasure, were after all more divine than this well-ordered, active,
      useless machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that his mother had wounded his vanity he could criticize her thus.
      But he could not rebel. To the end of his days he could probably go on
      doing what she wanted. He watched with a cold interest the duel between
      her and Miss Abbott. Mrs. Herriton&rsquo;s policy only appeared gradually. It
      was to prevent Miss Abbott interfering with the child at all costs, and if
      possible to prevent her at a small cost. Pride was the only solid element
      in her disposition. She could not bear to seem less charitable than
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am planning what can be done,&rdquo; she would tell people, &ldquo;and that kind
      Caroline Abbott is helping me. It is no business of either of us, but we
      are getting to feel that the baby must not be left entirely to that
      horrible man. It would be unfair to little Irma; after all, he is her
      half-brother. No, we have come to nothing definite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Abbott was equally civil, but not to be appeased by good intentions.
      The child&rsquo;s welfare was a sacred duty to her, not a matter of pride or
      even of sentiment. By it alone, she felt, could she undo a little of the
      evil that she had permitted to come into the world. To her imagination
      Monteriano had become a magic city of vice, beneath whose towers no person
      could grow up happy or pure. Sawston, with its semi-detached houses and
      snobby schools, its book teas and bazaars, was certainly petty and dull;
      at times she found it even contemptible. But it was not a place of sin,
      and at Sawston, either with the Herritons or with herself, the baby should
      grow up.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as it was inevitable, Mrs. Herriton wrote a letter for Waters and
      Adamson to send to Gino&mdash;the oddest letter; Philip saw a copy of it
      afterwards. Its ostensible purpose was to complain of the picture
      postcards. Right at the end, in a few nonchalant sentences, she offered to
      adopt the child, provided that Gino would undertake never to come near it,
      and would surrender some of Lilia&rsquo;s money for its education.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo; she asked her son. &ldquo;It would not do to let him
      know that we are anxious for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly he will never suppose that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what effect will the letter have on him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he gets it he will do a sum. If it is less expensive in the long run
      to part with a little money and to be clear of the baby, he will part with
      it. If he would lose, he will adopt the tone of the loving father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, you&rsquo;re shockingly cynical.&rdquo; After a pause she added, &ldquo;How would the
      sum work out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure. But if you wanted to ensure the baby being posted
      by return, you should have sent a little sum to HIM. Oh, I&rsquo;m not cynical&mdash;at
      least I only go by what I know of him. But I am weary of the whole show.
      Weary of Italy. Weary, weary, weary. Sawston&rsquo;s a kind, pitiful place,
      isn&rsquo;t it? I will go walk in it and seek comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled as he spoke, for the sake of not appearing serious. When he had
      left her she began to smile also.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to the Abbotts&rsquo; that he walked. Mr. Abbott offered him tea, and
      Caroline, who was keeping up her Italian in the next room, came in to pour
      it out. He told them that his mother had written to Signor Carella, and
      they both uttered fervent wishes for her success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very fine of Mrs. Herriton, very fine indeed,&rdquo; said Mr. Abbott, who, like
      every one else, knew nothing of his daughter&rsquo;s exasperating behaviour.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it will mean a lot of expense. She will get nothing out of
      Italy without paying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are sure to be incidental expenses,&rdquo; said Philip cautiously. Then
      he turned to Miss Abbott and said, &ldquo;Do you suppose we shall have
      difficulty with the man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends,&rdquo; she replied, with equal caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what you saw of him, should you conclude that he would make an
      affectionate parent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t go by what I saw of him, but by what I know of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you conclude from that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he is a thoroughly wicked man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet thoroughly wicked men have loved their children. Look at Rodrigo
      Borgia, for example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have also seen examples of that in my district.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this remark the admirable young woman rose, and returned to keep up
      her Italian. She puzzled Philip extremely. He could understand enthusiasm,
      but she did not seem the least enthusiastic. He could understand pure
      cussedness, but it did not seem to be that either. Apparently she was
      deriving neither amusement nor profit from the struggle. Why, then, had
      she undertaken it? Perhaps she was not sincere. Perhaps, on the whole,
      that was most likely. She must be professing one thing and aiming at
      another. What the other thing could be he did not stop to consider.
      Insincerity was becoming his stock explanation for anything unfamiliar,
      whether that thing was a kindly action or a high ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She fences well,&rdquo; he said to his mother afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What had you to fence about?&rdquo; she said suavely. Her son might know her
      tactics, but she refused to admit that he knew. She still pretended to him
      that the baby was the one thing she wanted, and had always wanted, and
      that Miss Abbott was her valued ally.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when, next week, the reply came from Italy, she showed him no face of
      triumph. &ldquo;Read the letters,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We have failed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gino wrote in his own language, but the solicitors had sent a laborious
      English translation, where &ldquo;Preghiatissima Signora&rdquo; was rendered as &ldquo;Most
      Praiseworthy Madam,&rdquo; and every delicate compliment and superlative&mdash;superlatives
      are delicate in Italian&mdash;would have felled an ox. For a moment Philip
      forgot the matter in the manner; this grotesque memorial of the land he
      had loved moved him almost to tears. He knew the originals of these
      lumbering phrases; he also had sent &ldquo;sincere auguries&rdquo;; he also had
      addressed letters&mdash;who writes at home?&mdash;from the Caffe
      Garibaldi. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know I was still such an ass,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t
      I realize that it&rsquo;s merely tricks of expression? A bounder&rsquo;s a bounder,
      whether he lives in Sawston or Monteriano.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it disheartening?&rdquo; said his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then read that Gino could not accept the generous offer. His paternal
      heart would not permit him to abandon this symbol of his deplored spouse.
      As for the picture post-cards, it displeased him greatly that they had
      been obnoxious. He would send no more. Would Mrs. Herriton, with her
      notorious kindness, explain this to Irma, and thank her for those which
      Irma (courteous Miss!) had sent to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sum works out against us,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;Or perhaps he is putting up
      the price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mrs. Herriton decidedly. &ldquo;It is not that. For some perverse
      reason he will not part with the child. I must go and tell poor Caroline.
      She will be equally distressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She returned from the visit in the most extraordinary condition. Her face
      was red, she panted for breath, there were dark circles round her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The impudence!&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;The cursed impudence! Oh, I&rsquo;m swearing. I
      don&rsquo;t care. That beastly woman&mdash;how dare she interfere&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;Philip,
      dear, I&rsquo;m sorry. It&rsquo;s no good. You must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go where? Do sit down. What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; This outburst of violence from
      his elegant ladylike mother pained him dreadfully. He had not known that
      it was in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t accept&mdash;won&rsquo;t accept the letter as final. You must go to
      Monteriano!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he shouted back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been and I&rsquo;ve failed. I&rsquo;ll never see the
      place again. I hate Italy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t go, she will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abbott?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Going alone; would start this evening. I offered to write; she said
      it was &lsquo;too late!&rsquo; Too late! The child, if you please&mdash;Irma&rsquo;s brother&mdash;to
      live with her, to be brought up by her and her father at our very gates,
      to go to school like a gentleman, she paying. Oh, you&rsquo;re a man! It doesn&rsquo;t
      matter for you. You can laugh. But I know what people say; and that woman
      goes to Italy this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to be inspired. &ldquo;Then let her go! Let her mess with Italy by
      herself. She&rsquo;ll come to grief somehow. Italy&rsquo;s too dangerous, too&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop that nonsense, Philip. I will not be disgraced by her. I WILL have
      the child. Pay all we&rsquo;ve got for it. I will have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her go to Italy!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Let her meddle with what she doesn&rsquo;t
      understand! Look at this letter! The man who wrote it will marry her, or
      murder her, or do for her somehow. He&rsquo;s a bounder, but he&rsquo;s not an English
      bounder. He&rsquo;s mysterious and terrible. He&rsquo;s got a country behind him
      that&rsquo;s upset people from the beginning of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harriet!&rdquo; exclaimed his mother. &ldquo;Harriet shall go too. Harriet, now, will
      be invaluable!&rdquo; And before Philip had stopped talking nonsense, she had
      planned the whole thing and was looking out the trains.

    <h2>
      Chapter 6
    </h2>
    <p>
      Italy, Philip had always maintained, is only her true self in the height
      of the summer, when the tourists have left her, and her soul awakes under
      the beams of a vertical sun. He now had every opportunity of seeing her at
      her best, for it was nearly the middle of August before he went out to
      meet Harriet in the Tirol.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found his sister in a dense cloud five thousand feet above the sea,
      chilled to the bone, overfed, bored, and not at all unwilling to be
      fetched away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It upsets one&rsquo;s plans terribly,&rdquo; she remarked, as she squeezed out her
      sponges, &ldquo;but obviously it is my duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did mother explain it all to you?&rdquo; asked Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed! Mother has written me a really beautiful letter. She
      describes how it was that she gradually got to feel that we must rescue
      the poor baby from its terrible surroundings, how she has tried by letter,
      and it is no good&mdash;nothing but insincere compliments and hypocrisy
      came back. Then she says, &lsquo;There is nothing like personal influence; you
      and Philip will succeed where I have failed.&rsquo; She says, too, that Caroline
      Abbott has been wonderful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caroline feels it as keenly almost as us. That is because she knows the
      man. Oh, he must be loathsome! Goodness me! I&rsquo;ve forgotten to pack the
      ammonia!... It has been a terrible lesson for Caroline, but I fancy it is
      her turning-point. I can&rsquo;t help liking to think that out of all this evil
      good will come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip saw no prospect of good, nor of beauty either. But the expedition
      promised to be highly comic. He was not averse to it any longer; he was
      simply indifferent to all in it except the humours. These would be
      wonderful. Harriet, worked by her mother; Mrs. Herriton, worked by Miss
      Abbott; Gino, worked by a cheque&mdash;what better entertainment could he
      desire? There was nothing to distract him this time; his sentimentality
      had died, so had his anxiety for the family honour. He might be a puppet&rsquo;s
      puppet, but he knew exactly the disposition of the strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      They travelled for thirteen hours down-hill, whilst the streams broadened
      and the mountains shrank, and the vegetation changed, and the people
      ceased being ugly and drinking beer, and began instead to drink wine and
      to be beautiful. And the train which had picked them at sunrise out of a
      waste of glaciers and hotels was waltzing at sunset round the walls of
      Verona.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absurd nonsense they talk about the heat,&rdquo; said Philip, as they drove
      from the station. &ldquo;Supposing we were here for pleasure, what could be more
      pleasurable than this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear, though, they are remarking on the cold?&rdquo; said Harriet
      nervously. &ldquo;I should never have thought it cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And on the second day the heat struck them, like a hand laid over the
      mouth, just as they were walking to see the tomb of Juliet. From that
      moment everything went wrong. They fled from Verona. Harriet&rsquo;s sketch-book
      was stolen, and the bottle of ammonia in her trunk burst over her
      prayer-book, so that purple patches appeared on all her clothes. Then, as
      she was going through Mantua at four in the morning, Philip made her look
      out of the window because it was Virgil&rsquo;s birthplace, and a smut flew in
      her eye, and Harriet with a smut in her eye was notorious. At Bologna they
      stopped twenty-four hours to rest. It was a FESTA, and children blew
      bladder whistles night and day. &ldquo;What a religion!&rdquo; said Harriet. The hotel
      smelt, two puppies were asleep on her bed, and her bedroom window looked
      into a belfry, which saluted her slumbering form every quarter of an hour.
      Philip left his walking-stick, his socks, and the Baedeker at Bologna; she
      only left her sponge-bag. Next day they crossed the Apennines with a
      train-sick child and a hot lady, who told them that never, never before
      had she sweated so profusely. &ldquo;Foreigners are a filthy nation,&rdquo; said
      Harriet. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if there are tunnels; open the windows.&rdquo; He obeyed,
      and she got another smut in her eye. Nor did Florence improve matters.
      Eating, walking, even a cross word would bathe them both in boiling water.
      Philip, who was slighter of build, and less conscientious, suffered less.
      But Harriet had never been to Florence, and between the hours of eight and
      eleven she crawled like a wounded creature through the streets, and
      swooned before various masterpieces of art. It was an irritable couple who
      took tickets to Monteriano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Singles or returns?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A single for me,&rdquo; said Harriet peevishly; &ldquo;I shall never get back alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweet creature!&rdquo; said her brother, suddenly breaking down. &ldquo;How helpful
      you will be when we come to Signor Carella!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose,&rdquo; said Harriet, standing still among a whirl of porters&mdash;&ldquo;do
      you suppose I am going to enter that man&rsquo;s house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what have you come for, pray? For ornament?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see that you do your duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thanks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So mother told me. For goodness sake get the tickets; here comes that hot
      woman again! She has the impudence to bow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother told you, did she?&rdquo; said Philip wrathfully, as he went to struggle
      for tickets at a slit so narrow that they were handed to him edgeways.
      Italy was beastly, and Florence station is the centre of beastly Italy.
      But he had a strange feeling that he was to blame for it all; that a
      little influx into him of virtue would make the whole land not beastly but
      amusing. For there was enchantment, he was sure of that; solid
      enchantment, which lay behind the porters and the screaming and the dust.
      He could see it in the terrific blue sky beneath which they travelled, in
      the whitened plain which gripped life tighter than a frost, in the
      exhausted reaches of the Arno, in the ruins of brown castles which stood
      quivering upon the hills. He could see it, though his head ached and his
      skin was twitching, though he was here as a puppet, and though his sister
      knew how he was here. There was nothing pleasant in that journey to
      Monteriano station. But nothing&mdash;not even the discomfort&mdash;was
      commonplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do people live inside?&rdquo; asked Harriet. They had exchanged
      railway-carriage for the legno, and the legno had emerged from the
      withered trees, and had revealed to them their destination. Philip, to be
      annoying, answered &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do they do there?&rdquo; continued Harriet, with a frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a caffe. A prison. A theatre. A church. Walls. A view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for me, thank you,&rdquo; said Harriet, after a weighty pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody asked you, Miss, you see. Now Lilia was asked by such a nice young
      gentleman, with curls all over his forehead, and teeth just as white as
      father makes them.&rdquo; Then his manner changed. &ldquo;But, Harriet, do you see
      nothing wonderful or attractive in that place&mdash;nothing at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all. It&rsquo;s frightful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it is. But it&rsquo;s old&mdash;awfully old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beauty is the only test,&rdquo; said Harriet. &ldquo;At least so you told me when I
      sketched old buildings&mdash;for the sake, I suppose, of making yourself
      unpleasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m perfectly right. But at the same time&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;so
      many things have happened here&mdash;people have lived so hard and so
      splendidly&mdash;I can&rsquo;t explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think you could. It doesn&rsquo;t seem the best moment to begin
      your Italy mania. I thought you were cured of it by now. Instead, will you
      kindly tell me what you are going to do when you arrive. I do beg you will
      not be taken unawares this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, Harriet, I shall settle you at the Stella d&rsquo;Italia, in the comfort
      that befits your sex and disposition. Then I shall make myself some tea.
      After tea I shall take a book into Santa Deodata&rsquo;s, and read there. It is
      always fresh and cool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The martyred Harriet exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not clever, Philip. I don&rsquo;t go in for
      it, as you know. But I know what&rsquo;s rude. And I know what&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; she shouted, bouncing on the cushions of the legno and startling
      all the fleas. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of cleverness if a man&rsquo;s murdered a
      woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harriet, I am hot. To whom do you refer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He. Her. If you don&rsquo;t look out he&rsquo;ll murder you. I wish he would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut tut, tutlet! You&rsquo;d find a corpse extraordinarily inconvenient.&rdquo; Then
      he tried to be less aggravating. &ldquo;I heartily dislike the fellow, but we
      know he didn&rsquo;t murder her. In that letter, though she said a lot, she
      never said he was physically cruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has murdered her. The things he did&mdash;things one can&rsquo;t even
      mention&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things which one must mention if one&rsquo;s to talk at all. And things which
      one must keep in their proper place. Because he was unfaithful to his
      wife, it doesn&rsquo;t follow that in every way he&rsquo;s absolutely vile.&rdquo; He looked
      at the city. It seemed to approve his remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the supreme test. The man who is unchivalrous to a woman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, stow it! Take it to the Back Kitchen. It&rsquo;s no more a supreme test
      than anything else. The Italians never were chivalrous from the first. If
      you condemn him for that, you&rsquo;ll condemn the whole lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I condemn the whole lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the French as well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the French as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things aren&rsquo;t so jolly easy,&rdquo; said Philip, more to himself than to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for Harriet things were easy, though not jolly, and she turned upon
      her brother yet again. &ldquo;What about the baby, pray? You&rsquo;ve said a lot of
      smart things and whittled away morality and religion and I don&rsquo;t know
      what; but what about the baby? You think me a fool, but I&rsquo;ve been noticing
      you all today, and you haven&rsquo;t mentioned the baby once. You haven&rsquo;t
      thought about it, even. You don&rsquo;t care. Philip! I shall not speak to you.
      You are intolerable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kept her promise, and never opened her lips all the rest of the way.
      But her eyes glowed with anger and resolution. For she was a straight,
      brave woman, as well as a peevish one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip acknowledged her reproof to be true. He did not care about the baby
      one straw. Nevertheless, he meant to do his duty, and he was fairly
      confident of success. If Gino would have sold his wife for a thousand
      lire, for how much less would he not sell his child? It was just a
      commercial transaction. Why should it interfere with other things? His
      eyes were fixed on the towers again, just as they had been fixed when he
      drove with Miss Abbott. But this time his thoughts were pleasanter, for he
      had no such grave business on his mind. It was in the spirit of the
      cultivated tourist that he approached his destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the towers, rough as any other, was topped by a cross&mdash;the
      tower of the Collegiate Church of Santa Deodata. She was a holy maiden of
      the Dark Ages, the city&rsquo;s patron saint, and sweetness and barbarity mingle
      strangely in her story. So holy was she that all her life she lay upon her
      back in the house of her mother, refusing to eat, refusing to play,
      refusing to work. The devil, envious of such sanctity, tempted her in
      various ways. He dangled grapes above her, he showed her fascinating toys,
      he pushed soft pillows beneath her aching head. When all proved vain he
      tripped up the mother and flung her downstairs before her very eyes. But
      so holy was the saint that she never picked her mother up, but lay upon
      her back through all, and thus assured her throne in Paradise. She was
      only fifteen when she died, which shows how much is within the reach of
      any school-girl. Those who think her life was unpractical need only think
      of the victories upon Poggibonsi, San Gemignano, Volterra, Siena itself&mdash;all
      gained through the invocation of her name; they need only look at the
      church which rose over her grave. The grand schemes for a marble facade
      were never carried out, and it is brown unfinished stone until this day.
      But for the inside Giotto was summoned to decorate the walls of the nave.
      Giotto came&mdash;that is to say, he did not come, German research having
      decisively proved&mdash;but at all events the nave is covered with
      frescoes, and so are two chapels in the left transept, and the arch into
      the choir, and there are scraps in the choir itself. There the decoration
      stopped, till in the full spring of the Renaissance a great painter came
      to pay a few weeks&rsquo; visit to his friend the Lord of Monteriano. In the
      intervals between the banquets and the discussions on Latin etymology and
      the dancing, he would stroll over to the church, and there in the fifth
      chapel to the right he has painted two frescoes of the death and burial of
      Santa Deodata. That is why Baedeker gives the place a star.
    </p>
    <p>
      Santa Deodata was better company than Harriet, and she kept Philip in a
      pleasant dream until the legno drew up at the hotel. Every one there was
      asleep, for it was still the hour when only idiots were moving. There were
      not even any beggars about. The cabman put their bags down in the passage&mdash;they
      had left heavy luggage at the station&mdash;and strolled about till he
      came on the landlady&rsquo;s room and woke her, and sent her to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Harriet pronounced the monosyllable &ldquo;Go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go where?&rdquo; asked Philip, bowing to the landlady, who was swimming down
      the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Italian. Go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buona sera, signora padrona. Si ritorna volontieri a Monteriano!&rdquo; (Don&rsquo;t
      be a goose. I&rsquo;m not going now. You&rsquo;re in the way, too.) &ldquo;Vorrei due camere&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go. This instant. Now. I&rsquo;ll stand it no longer. Go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m damned if I&rsquo;ll go. I want my tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swear if you like!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Blaspheme! Abuse me! But understand, I&rsquo;m
      in earnest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harriet, don&rsquo;t act. Or act better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come here to get the baby back, and for nothing else. I&rsquo;ll not have
      this levity and slackness, and talk about pictures and churches. Think of
      mother; did she send you out for THEM?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of mother and don&rsquo;t straddle across the stairs. Let the cabman and
      the landlady come down, and let me go up and choose rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harriet, are you mad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like. But you will not come up till you have seen the Italian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La signorina si sente male,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;C&rsquo; e il sole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poveretta!&rdquo; cried the landlady and the cabman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me alone!&rdquo; said Harriet, snarling round at them. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for
      the lot of you. I&rsquo;m English, and neither you&rsquo;ll come down nor he up till
      he goes for the baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La prego-piano-piano-c e un&rsquo; altra signorina che dorme&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall probably be arrested for brawling, Harriet. Have you the very
      slightest sense of the ludicrous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet had not; that was why she could be so powerful. She had concocted
      this scene in the carriage, and nothing should baulk her of it. To the
      abuse in front and the coaxing behind she was equally indifferent. How
      long she would have stood like a glorified Horatius, keeping the staircase
      at both ends, was never to be known. For the young lady, whose sleep they
      were disturbing, awoke and opened her bedroom door, and came out on to the
      landing. She was Miss Abbott.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip&rsquo;s first coherent feeling was one of indignation. To be run by his
      mother and hectored by his sister was as much as he could stand. The
      intervention of a third female drove him suddenly beyond politeness. He
      was about to say exactly what he thought about the thing from beginning to
      end. But before he could do so Harriet also had seen Miss Abbott. She
      uttered a shrill cry of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, Caroline, here of all people!&rdquo; And in spite of the heat she darted
      up the stairs and imprinted an affectionate kiss upon her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip had an inspiration. &ldquo;You will have a lot to tell Miss Abbott,
      Harriet, and she may have as much to tell you. So I&rsquo;ll pay my call on
      Signor Carella, as you suggested, and see how things stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Abbott uttered some noise of greeting or alarm. He did not reply to
      it or approach nearer to her. Without even paying the cabman, he escaped
      into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tear each other&rsquo;s eyes out!&rdquo; he cried, gesticulating at the facade of the
      hotel. &ldquo;Give it to her, Harriet! Teach her to leave us alone. Give it to
      her, Caroline! Teach her to be grateful to you. Go it, ladies; go it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such people as observed him were interested, but did not conclude that he
      was mad. This aftermath of conversation is not unknown in Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to think how amusing it was; but it would not do&mdash;Miss
      Abbott&rsquo;s presence affected him too personally. Either she suspected him of
      dishonesty, or else she was being dishonest herself. He preferred to
      suppose the latter. Perhaps she had seen Gino, and they had prepared some
      elaborate mortification for the Herritons. Perhaps Gino had sold the baby
      cheap to her for a joke: it was just the kind of joke that would appeal to
      him. Philip still remembered the laughter that had greeted his fruitless
      journey, and the uncouth push that had toppled him on to the bed. And
      whatever it might mean, Miss Abbott&rsquo;s presence spoilt the comedy: she
      would do nothing funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this short meditation he had walked through the city, and was out
      on the other side. &ldquo;Where does Signor Carella live?&rdquo; he asked the men at
      the Dogana.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; said a little girl, springing out of the ground as
      Italian children will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will show you,&rdquo; said the Dogana men, nodding reassuringly. &ldquo;Follow
      her always, always, and you will come to no harm. She is a trustworthy
      guide. She is my
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    daughter.&rdquo;
     cousin.&rdquo;
     sister.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Philip knew these relatives well: they ramify, if need be, all over the
      peninsula.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you chance to know whether Signor Carella is in?&rdquo; he asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had just seen him go in. Philip nodded. He was looking forward to the
      interview this time: it would be an intellectual duet with a man of no
      great intellect. What was Miss Abbott up to? That was one of the things he
      was going to discover. While she had it out with Harriet, he would have it
      out with Gino. He followed the Dogana&rsquo;s relative softly, like a
      diplomatist.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not follow her long, for this was the Volterra gate, and the house
      was exactly opposite to it. In half a minute they had scrambled down the
      mule-track and reached the only practicable entrance. Philip laughed,
      partly at the thought of Lilia in such a building, partly in the
      confidence of victory. Meanwhile the Dogana&rsquo;s relative lifted up her voice
      and gave a shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an impressive interval there was no reply. Then the figure of a woman
      appeared high up on the loggia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is Perfetta,&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see Signor Carella,&rdquo; cried Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out,&rdquo; echoed the girl complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why on earth did you say he was in?&rdquo; He could have strangled her for
      temper. He had been just ripe for an interview&mdash;just the right
      combination of indignation and acuteness: blood hot, brain cool. But
      nothing ever did go right in Monteriano. &ldquo;When will he be back?&rdquo; he called
      to Perfetta. It really was too bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not know. He was away on business. He might be back this evening,
      he might not. He had gone to Poggibonsi.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of this word the little girl put her fingers to her nose and
      swept them at the plain. She sang as she did so, even as her foremothers
      had sung seven hundred years back&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Poggibonizzi, fatti in la,
  Che Monteriano si fa citta!
</pre>
    <p>
      Then she asked Philip for a halfpenny. A German lady, friendly to the
      Past, had given her one that very spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have to leave a message,&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now Perfetta has gone for her basket,&rdquo; said the little girl. &ldquo;When she
      returns she will lower it&mdash;so. Then you will put your card into it.
      Then she will raise it&mdash;thus. By this means&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Perfetta returned, Philip remembered to ask after the baby. It took
      longer to find than the basket, and he stood perspiring in the evening
      sun, trying to avoid the smell of the drains and to prevent the little
      girl from singing against Poggibonsi. The olive-trees beside him were
      draped with the weekly&mdash;or more probably the monthly&mdash;wash. What
      a frightful spotty blouse! He could not think where he had seen it. Then
      he remembered that it was Lilia&rsquo;s. She had brought it &ldquo;to hack about in&rdquo;
       at Sawston, and had taken it to Italy because &ldquo;in Italy anything does.&rdquo; He
      had rebuked her for the sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful as an angel!&rdquo; bellowed Perfetta, holding out something which
      must be Lilia&rsquo;s baby. &ldquo;But who am I addressing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you&mdash;here is my card.&rdquo; He had written on it a civil request to
      Gino for an interview next morning. But before he placed it in the basket
      and revealed his identity, he wished to find something out. &ldquo;Has a young
      lady happened to call here lately&mdash;a young English lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perfetta begged his pardon: she was a little deaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young lady&mdash;pale, large, tall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not quite catch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A YOUNG LADY!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfetta is deaf when she chooses,&rdquo; said the Dogana&rsquo;s relative. At last
      Philip admitted the peculiarity and strode away. He paid off the
      detestable child at the Volterra gate. She got two nickel pieces and was
      not pleased, partly because it was too much, partly because he did not
      look pleased when he gave it to her. He caught her fathers and cousins
      winking at each other as he walked past them. Monteriano seemed in one
      conspiracy to make him look a fool. He felt tired and anxious and muddled,
      and not sure of anything except that his temper was lost. In this mood he
      returned to the Stella d&rsquo;Italia, and there, as he was ascending the
      stairs, Miss Abbott popped out of the dining-room on the first floor and
      beckoned to him mysteriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to make myself some tea,&rdquo; he said, with his hand still on the
      banisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be grateful&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he followed her into the dining-room and shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;Harriet knows nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more do I. He was out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s that to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He presented her with an unpleasant smile. She fenced well, as he had
      noticed before. &ldquo;He was out. You find me as ignorant as you have left
      Harriet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? Please, please Mr. Herriton, don&rsquo;t be mysterious: there
      isn&rsquo;t the time. Any moment Harriet may be down, and we shan&rsquo;t have decided
      how to behave to her. Sawston was different: we had to keep up
      appearances. But here we must speak out, and I think I can trust you to do
      it. Otherwise we&rsquo;ll never start clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray let us start clear,&rdquo; said Philip, pacing up and down the room.
      &ldquo;Permit me to begin by asking you a question. In which capacity have you
      come to Monteriano&mdash;spy or traitor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spy!&rdquo; she answered, without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation. She was standing by
      the little Gothic window as she spoke&mdash;the hotel had been a palace
      once&mdash;and with her finger she was following the curves of the
      moulding as if they might feel beautiful and strange. &ldquo;Spy,&rdquo; she repeated,
      for Philip was bewildered at learning her guilt so easily, and could not
      answer a word. &ldquo;Your mother has behaved dishonourably all through. She
      never wanted the child; no harm in that; but she is too proud to let it
      come to me. She has done all she could to wreck things; she did not tell
      you everything; she has told Harriet nothing at all; she has lied or acted
      lies everywhere. I cannot trust your mother. So I have come here alone&mdash;all
      across Europe; no one knows it; my father thinks I am in Normandy&mdash;to
      spy on Mrs. Herriton. Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s argue!&rdquo; for he had begun, almost
      mechanically, to rebuke her for impertinence. &ldquo;If you are here to get the
      child, I will help you; if you are here to fail, I shall get it instead of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hopeless to expect you to believe me,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;But I can
      assert that we are here to get the child, even if it costs us all we&rsquo;ve
      got. My mother has fixed no money limit whatever. I am here to carry out
      her instructions. I think that you will approve of them, as you have
      practically dictated them. I do not approve of them. They are absurd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded carelessly. She did not mind what he said. All she wanted was
      to get the baby out of Monteriano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harriet also carries out your instructions,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;She, however,
      approves of them, and does not know that they proceed from you. I think,
      Miss Abbott, you had better take entire charge of the rescue party. I have
      asked for an interview with Signor Carella tomorrow morning. Do you
      acquiesce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might I ask for details of your interview with him? They might be helpful
      to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had spoken at random. To his delight she suddenly collapsed. Her hand
      fell from the window. Her face was red with more than the reflection of
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My interview&mdash;how do you know of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Perfetta, if it interests you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who ever is Perfetta?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The woman who must have let you in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into Signor Carella&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Herriton!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;How could you believe her? Do you suppose
      that I would have entered that man&rsquo;s house, knowing about him all that I
      do? I think you have very odd ideas of what is possible for a lady. I hear
      you wanted Harriet to go. Very properly she refused. Eighteen months ago I
      might have done such a thing. But I trust I have learnt how to behave by
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip began to see that there were two Miss Abbotts&mdash;the Miss Abbott
      who could travel alone to Monteriano, and the Miss Abbott who could not
      enter Gino&rsquo;s house when she got there. It was an amusing discovery. Which
      of them would respond to his next move?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I misunderstood Perfetta. Where did you have your interview,
      then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not an interview&mdash;an accident&mdash;I am very sorry&mdash;I meant
      you to have the chance of seeing him first. Though it is your fault. You
      are a day late. You were due here yesterday. So I came yesterday, and, not
      finding you, went up to the Rocca&mdash;you know that kitchen-garden where
      they let you in, and there is a ladder up to a broken tower, where you can
      stand and see all the other towers below you and the plain and all the
      other hills?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. I know the Rocca; I told you of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I went up in the evening for the sunset: I had nothing to do. He was
      in the garden: it belongs to a friend of his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you talked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very awkward for me. But I had to talk: he seemed to make me. You
      see he thought I was here as a tourist; he thinks so still. He intended to
      be civil, and I judged it better to be civil also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of what did you talk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The weather&mdash;there will be rain, he says, by tomorrow evening&mdash;the
      other towns, England, myself, about you a little, and he actually
      mentioned Lilia. He was perfectly disgusting; he pretended he loved her;
      he offered to show me her grave&mdash;the grave of the woman he has
      murdered!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Abbott, he is not a murderer. I have just been driving that
      into Harriet. And when you know the Italians as well as I do, you will
      realize that in all that he said to you he was perfectly sincere. The
      Italians are essentially dramatic; they look on death and love as
      spectacles. I don&rsquo;t doubt that he persuaded himself, for the moment, that
      he had behaved admirably, both as husband and widower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be right,&rdquo; said Miss Abbott, impressed for the first time. &ldquo;When
      I tried to pave the way, so to speak&mdash;to hint that he had not behaved
      as he ought&mdash;well, it was no good at all. He couldn&rsquo;t or wouldn&rsquo;t
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something very humorous in the idea of Miss Abbott approaching
      Gino, on the Rocca, in the spirit of a district visitor. Philip, whose
      temper was returning, laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harriet would say he has no sense of sin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harriet may be right, I am afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If so, perhaps he isn&rsquo;t sinful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Abbott was not one to encourage levity. &ldquo;I know what he has done,&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;What he says and what he thinks is of very little importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip smiled at her crudity. &ldquo;I should like to hear, though, what he said
      about me. Is he preparing a warm reception?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, not that. I never told him that you and Harriet were coming. You
      could have taken him by surprise if you liked. He only asked for you, and
      wished he hadn&rsquo;t been so rude to you eighteen months ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a memory the fellow has for little things!&rdquo; He turned away as he
      spoke, for he did not want her to see his face. It was suffused with
      pleasure. For an apology, which would have been intolerable eighteen
      months ago, was gracious and agreeable now.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not let this pass. &ldquo;You did not think it a little thing at the
      time. You told me he had assaulted you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lost my temper,&rdquo; said Philip lightly. His vanity had been appeased, and
      he knew it. This tiny piece of civility had changed his mood. &ldquo;Did he
      really&mdash;what exactly did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he was sorry&mdash;pleasantly, as Italians do say such things.
      But he never mentioned the baby once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What did the baby matter when the world was suddenly right way up? Philip
      smiled, and was shocked at himself for smiling, and smiled again. For
      romance had come back to Italy; there were no cads in her; she was
      beautiful, courteous, lovable, as of old. And Miss Abbott&mdash;she, too,
      was beautiful in her way, for all her gaucheness and conventionality. She
      really cared about life, and tried to live it properly. And Harriet&mdash;even
      Harriet tried.
    </p>
    <p>
      This admirable change in Philip proceeds from nothing admirable, and may
      therefore provoke the gibes of the cynical. But angels and other practical
      people will accept it reverently, and write it down as good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The view from the Rocca (small gratuity) is finest at sunset,&rdquo; he
      murmured, more to himself than to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he never mentioned the baby once,&rdquo; Miss Abbott repeated. But she had
      returned to the window, and again her finger pursued the delicate curves.
      He watched her in silence, and was more attracted to her than he had ever
      been before. She really was the strangest mixture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The view from the Rocca&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t it fine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What isn&rsquo;t fine here?&rdquo; she answered gently, and then added, &ldquo;I wish I was
      Harriet,&rdquo; throwing an extraordinary meaning into the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because Harriet&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She would not go further, but he believed that she had paid homage to the
      complexity of life. For her, at all events, the expedition was neither
      easy nor jolly. Beauty, evil, charm, vulgarity, mystery&mdash;she also
      acknowledged this tangle, in spite of herself. And her voice thrilled him
      when she broke silence with &ldquo;Mr. Herriton&mdash;come here&mdash;look at
      this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She removed a pile of plates from the Gothic window, and they leant out of
      it. Close opposite, wedged between mean houses, there rose up one of the
      great towers. It is your tower: you stretch a barricade between it and the
      hotel, and the traffic is blocked in a moment. Farther up, where the
      street empties out by the church, your connections, the Merli and the
      Capocchi, do likewise. They command the Piazza, you the Siena gate. No one
      can move in either but he shall be instantly slain, either by bows or by
      crossbows, or by Greek fire. Beware, however, of the back bedroom windows.
      For they are menaced by the tower of the Aldobrandeschi, and before now
      arrows have stuck quivering over the washstand. Guard these windows well,
      lest there be a repetition of the events of February 1338, when the hotel
      was surprised from the rear, and your dearest friend&mdash;you could just
      make out that it was he&mdash;was thrown at you over the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It reaches up to heaven,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;and down to the other place.&rdquo; The
      summit of the tower was radiant in the sun, while its base was in shadow
      and pasted over with advertisements. &ldquo;Is it to be a symbol of the town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave no hint that she understood him. But they remained together at
      the window because it was a little cooler and so pleasant. Philip found a
      certain grace and lightness in his companion which he had never noticed in
      England. She was appallingly narrow, but her consciousness of wider things
      gave to her narrowness a pathetic charm. He did not suspect that he was
      more graceful too. For our vanity is such that we hold our own characters
      immutable, and we are slow to acknowledge that they have changed, even for
      the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Citizens came out for a little stroll before dinner. Some of them stood
      and gazed at the advertisements on the tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely that isn&rsquo;t an opera-bill?&rdquo; said Miss Abbott.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip put on his pince-nez. &ldquo;&lsquo;Lucia di Lammermoor. By the Master
      Donizetti. Unique representation. This evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is there an opera? Right up here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes. These people know how to live. They would sooner have a thing
      bad than not have it at all. That is why they have got to have so much
      that is good. However bad the performance is tonight, it will be alive.
      Italians don&rsquo;t love music silently, like the beastly Germans. The audience
      takes its share&mdash;sometimes more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned on her, but not unkindly. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re here to rescue a child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He cursed himself for the remark. All the pleasure and the light went out
      of her face, and she became again Miss Abbott of Sawston&mdash;good, oh,
      most undoubtedly good, but most appallingly dull. Dull and remorseful: it
      is a deadly combination, and he strove against it in vain till he was
      interrupted by the opening of the dining-room door.
    </p>
    <p>
      They started as guiltily as if they had been flirting. Their interview had
      taken such an unexpected course. Anger, cynicism, stubborn morality&mdash;all
      had ended in a feeling of good-will towards each other and towards the
      city which had received them. And now Harriet was here&mdash;acrid,
      indissoluble, large; the same in Italy as in England&mdash;changing her
      disposition never, and her atmosphere under protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet even Harriet was human, and the better for a little tea. She did not
      scold Philip for finding Gino out, as she might reasonably have done. She
      showered civilities on Miss Abbott, exclaiming again and again that
      Caroline&rsquo;s visit was one of the most fortunate coincidences in the world.
      Caroline did not contradict her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see him tomorrow at ten, Philip. Well, don&rsquo;t forget the blank cheque.
      Say an hour for the business. No, Italians are so slow; say two. Twelve
      o&rsquo;clock. Lunch. Well&mdash;then it&rsquo;s no good going till the evening train.
      I can manage the baby as far as Florence&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sister, you can&rsquo;t run on like that. You don&rsquo;t buy a pair of
      gloves in two hours, much less a baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three hours, then, or four; or make him learn English ways. At Florence
      we get a nurse&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Harriet,&rdquo; said Miss Abbott, &ldquo;what if at first he was to refuse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the meaning of the word,&rdquo; said Harriet impressively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      told the landlady that Philip and I only want our rooms one night, and we
      shall keep to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say it will be all right. But, as I told you, I thought the man I
      met on the Rocca a strange, difficult man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s insolent to ladies, we know. But my brother can be trusted to bring
      him to his senses. That woman, Philip, whom you saw will carry the baby to
      the hotel. Of course you must tip her for it. And try, if you can, to get
      poor Lilia&rsquo;s silver bangles. They were nice quiet things, and will do for
      Irma. And there is an inlaid box I lent her&mdash;lent, not gave&mdash;to
      keep her handkerchiefs in. It&rsquo;s of no real value; but this is our only
      chance. Don&rsquo;t ask for it; but if you see it lying about, just say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Harriet; I&rsquo;ll try for the baby, but for nothing else. I promise to do
      that tomorrow, and to do it in the way you wish. But tonight, as we&rsquo;re all
      tired, we want a change of topic. We want relaxation. We want to go to the
      theatre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theatres here? And at such a moment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should hardly enjoy it, with the great interview impending,&rdquo; said Miss
      Abbott, with an anxious glance at Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not betray her, but said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s better than sitting
      in all the evening and getting nervous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His sister shook her head. &ldquo;Mother wouldn&rsquo;t like it. It would be most
      unsuitable&mdash;almost irreverent. Besides all that, foreign theatres are
      notorious. Don&rsquo;t you remember those letters in the &lsquo;Church Family
      Newspaper&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is an opera&mdash;&lsquo;Lucia di Lammermoor&rsquo;&mdash;Sir Walter Scott&mdash;classical,
      you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet&rsquo;s face grew resigned. &ldquo;Certainly one has so few opportunities of
      hearing music. It is sure to be very bad. But it might be better than
      sitting idle all the evening. We have no book, and I lost my crochet at
      Florence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. Miss Abbott, you are coming too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very kind of you, Mr. Herriton. In some ways I should enjoy it; but&mdash;excuse
      the suggestion&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think we ought to go to cheap seats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious me!&rdquo; cried Harriet, &ldquo;I should never have thought of that.
      As likely as not, we should have tried to save money and sat among the
      most awful people. One keeps on forgetting this is Italy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately I have no evening dress; and if the seats&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; said Philip, smiling at his timorous,
      scrupulous women-kind. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go as we are, and buy the best we can get.
      Monteriano is not formal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So this strenuous day of resolutions, plans, alarms, battles, victories,
      defeats, truces, ended at the opera. Miss Abbott and Harriet were both a
      little shame-faced. They thought of their friends at Sawston, who were
      supposing them to be now tilting against the powers of evil. What would
      Mrs. Herriton, or Irma, or the curates at the Back Kitchen say if they
      could see the rescue party at a place of amusement on the very first day
      of its mission? Philip, too, marvelled at his wish to go. He began to see
      that he was enjoying his time in Monteriano, in spite of the tiresomeness
      of his companions and the occasional contrariness of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been to this theatre many years before, on the occasion of a
      performance of &ldquo;La Zia di Carlo.&rdquo; Since then it had been thoroughly done
      up, in the tints of the beet-root and the tomato, and was in many other
      ways a credit to the little town. The orchestra had been enlarged, some of
      the boxes had terra-cotta draperies, and over each box was now suspended
      an enormous tablet, neatly framed, bearing upon it the number of that box.
      There was also a drop-scene, representing a pink and purple landscape,
      wherein sported many a lady lightly clad, and two more ladies lay along
      the top of the proscenium to steady a large and pallid clock. So rich and
      so appalling was the effect, that Philip could scarcely suppress a cry.
      There is something majestic in the bad taste of Italy; it is not the bad
      taste of a country which knows no better; it has not the nervous vulgarity
      of England, or the blinded vulgarity of Germany. It observes beauty, and
      chooses to pass it by. But it attains to beauty&rsquo;s confidence. This tiny
      theatre of Monteriano spraddled and swaggered with the best of them, and
      these ladies with their clock would have nodded to the young men on the
      ceiling of the Sistine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip had tried for a box, but all the best were taken: it was rather a
      grand performance, and he had to be content with stalls. Harriet was
      fretful and insular. Miss Abbott was pleasant, and insisted on praising
      everything: her only regret was that she had no pretty clothes with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do all right,&rdquo; said Philip, amused at her unwonted vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know; but pretty things pack as easily as ugly ones. We had no
      need to come to Italy like guys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time he did not reply, &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re here to rescue a baby.&rdquo; For he saw
      a charming picture, as charming a picture as he had seen for years&mdash;the
      hot red theatre; outside the theatre, towers and dark gates and mediaeval
      walls; beyond the walls olive-trees in the starlight and white winding
      roads and fireflies and untroubled dust; and here in the middle of it all,
      Miss Abbott, wishing she had not come looking like a guy. She had made the
      right remark. Most undoubtedly she had made the right remark. This stiff
      suburban woman was unbending before the shrine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like it at all?&rdquo; he asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most awfully.&rdquo; And by this bald interchange they convinced each other
      that Romance was here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet, meanwhile, had been coughing ominously at the drop-scene, which
      presently rose on the grounds of Ravenswood, and the chorus of Scotch
      retainers burst into cry. The audience accompanied with tappings and
      drummings, swaying in the melody like corn in the wind. Harriet, though
      she did not care for music, knew how to listen to it. She uttered an acid
      &ldquo;Shish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut it,&rdquo; whispered her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must make a stand from the beginning. They&rsquo;re talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is tiresome,&rdquo; murmured Miss Abbott; &ldquo;but perhaps it isn&rsquo;t for us to
      interfere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet shook her head and shished again. The people were quiet, not
      because it is wrong to talk during a chorus, but because it is natural to
      be civil to a visitor. For a little time she kept the whole house in
      order, and could smile at her brother complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her success annoyed him. He had grasped the principle of opera in Italy&mdash;it
      aims not at illusion but at entertainment&mdash;and he did not want this
      great evening-party to turn into a prayer-meeting. But soon the boxes
      began to fill, and Harriet&rsquo;s power was over. Families greeted each other
      across the auditorium. People in the pit hailed their brothers and sons in
      the chorus, and told them how well they were singing. When Lucia appeared
      by the fountain there was loud applause, and cries of &ldquo;Welcome to
      Monteriano!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ridiculous babies!&rdquo; said Harriet, settling down in her stall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it is the famous hot lady of the Apennines,&rdquo; cried Philip; &ldquo;the one
      who had never, never before&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh! Don&rsquo;t. She will be very vulgar. And I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s even worse here
      than in the tunnel. I wish we&rsquo;d never&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucia began to sing, and there was a moment&rsquo;s silence. She was stout and
      ugly; but her voice was still beautiful, and as she sang the theatre
      murmured like a hive of happy bees. All through the coloratura she was
      accompanied by sighs, and its top note was drowned in a shout of universal
      joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the opera proceeded. The singers drew inspiration from the audience,
      and the two great sextettes were rendered not unworthily. Miss Abbott fell
      into the spirit of the thing. She, too, chatted and laughed and applauded
      and encored, and rejoiced in the existence of beauty. As for Philip, he
      forgot himself as well as his mission. He was not even an enthusiastic
      visitor. For he had been in this place always. It was his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet, like M. Bovary on a more famous occasion, was trying to follow
      the plot. Occasionally she nudged her companions, and asked them what had
      become of Walter Scott. She looked round grimly. The audience sounded
      drunk, and even Caroline, who never took a drop, was swaying oddly.
      Violent waves of excitement, all arising from very little, went sweeping
      round the theatre. The climax was reached in the mad scene. Lucia, clad in
      white, as befitted her malady, suddenly gathered up her streaming hair and
      bowed her acknowledgment to the audience. Then from the back of the stage&mdash;she
      feigned not to see it&mdash;there advanced a kind of bamboo clothes-horse,
      stuck all over with bouquets. It was very ugly, and most of the flowers in
      it were false. Lucia knew this, and so did the audience; and they all knew
      that the clothes-horse was a piece of stage property, brought in to make
      the performance go year after year. None the less did it unloose the great
      deeps. With a scream of amazement and joy she embraced the animal, pulled
      out one or two practicable blossoms, pressed them to her lips, and flung
      them into her admirers. They flung them back, with loud melodious cries,
      and a little boy in one of the stageboxes snatched up his sister&rsquo;s
      carnations and offered them. &ldquo;Che carino!&rdquo; exclaimed the singer. She
      darted at the little boy and kissed him. Now the noise became tremendous.
      &ldquo;Silence! silence!&rdquo; shouted many old gentlemen behind. &ldquo;Let the divine
      creature continue!&rdquo; But the young men in the adjacent box were imploring
      Lucia to extend her civility to them. She refused, with a humorous,
      expressive gesture. One of them hurled a bouquet at her. She spurned it
      with her foot. Then, encouraged by the roars of the audience, she picked
      it up and tossed it to them. Harriet was always unfortunate. The bouquet
      struck her full in the chest, and a little billet-doux fell out of it into
      her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call this classical!&rdquo; she cried, rising from her seat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not even
      respectable! Philip! take me out at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose is it?&rdquo; shouted her brother, holding up the bouquet in one hand and
      the billet-doux in the other. &ldquo;Whose is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The house exploded, and one of the boxes was violently agitated, as if
      some one was being hauled to the front. Harriet moved down the gangway,
      and compelled Miss Abbott to follow her. Philip, still laughing and
      calling &ldquo;Whose is it?&rdquo; brought up the rear. He was drunk with excitement.
      The heat, the fatigue, and the enjoyment had mounted into his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the left!&rdquo; the people cried. &ldquo;The innamorato is to the left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He deserted his ladies and plunged towards the box. A young man was flung
      stomach downwards across the balustrade. Philip handed him up the bouquet
      and the note. Then his own hands were seized affectionately. It all seemed
      quite natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have you not written?&rdquo; cried the young man. &ldquo;Why do you take me by
      surprise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve written,&rdquo; said Philip hilariously. &ldquo;I left a note this
      afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence! silence!&rdquo; cried the audience, who were beginning to have enough.
      &ldquo;Let the divine creature continue.&rdquo; Miss Abbott and Harriet had
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; cried the young man. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t escape me now.&rdquo; For Philip was
      trying feebly to disengage his hands. Amiable youths bent out of the box
      and invited him to enter it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gino&rsquo;s friends are ours&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends?&rdquo; cried Gino. &ldquo;A relative! A brother! Fra Filippo, who has come
      all the way from England and never written.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left a message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The audience began to hiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you&mdash;ladies&mdash;there is not time&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next moment he was swinging by his arms. The moment after he shot over
      the balustrade into the box. Then the conductor, seeing that the incident
      was over, raised his baton. The house was hushed, and Lucia di Lammermoor
      resumed her song of madness and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip had whispered introductions to the pleasant people who had pulled
      him in&mdash;tradesmen&rsquo;s sons perhaps they were, or medical students, or
      solicitors&rsquo; clerks, or sons of other dentists. There is no knowing who is
      who in Italy. The guest of the evening was a private soldier. He shared
      the honour now with Philip. The two had to stand side by side in the
      front, and exchange compliments, whilst Gino presided, courteous, but
      delightfully familiar. Philip would have a spasm of horror at the muddle
      he had made. But the spasm would pass, and again he would be enchanted by
      the kind, cheerful voices, the laughter that was never vapid, and the
      light caress of the arm across his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not get away till the play was nearly finished, and Edgardo was
      singing amongst the tombs of ancestors. His new friends hoped to see him
      at the Garibaldi tomorrow evening. He promised; then he remembered that if
      they kept to Harriet&rsquo;s plan he would have left Monteriano. &ldquo;At ten
      o&rsquo;clock, then,&rdquo; he said to Gino. &ldquo;I want to speak to you alone. At ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo; laughed the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Abbott was sitting up for him when he got back. Harriet, it seemed,
      had gone straight to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was he, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, rather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you didn&rsquo;t settle anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no; how could I? The fact is&mdash;well, I got taken by surprise,
      but after all, what does it matter? There&rsquo;s no earthly reason why we
      shouldn&rsquo;t do the business pleasantly. He&rsquo;s a perfectly charming person,
      and so are his friends. I&rsquo;m his friend now&mdash;his long-lost brother.
      What&rsquo;s the harm? I tell you, Miss Abbott, it&rsquo;s one thing for England and
      another for Italy. There we plan and get on high moral horses. Here we
      find what asses we are, for things go off quite easily, all by themselves.
      My hat, what a night! Did you ever see a really purple sky and really
      silver stars before? Well, as I was saying, it&rsquo;s absurd to worry; he&rsquo;s not
      a porky father. He wants that baby as little as I do. He&rsquo;s been ragging my
      dear mother&mdash;just as he ragged me eighteen months ago, and I&rsquo;ve
      forgiven him. Oh, but he has a sense of humour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Abbott, too, had a wonderful evening, nor did she ever remember such
      stars or such a sky. Her head, too, was full of music, and that night when
      she opened the window her room was filled with warm, sweet air. She was
      bathed in beauty within and without; she could not go to bed for
      happiness. Had she ever been so happy before? Yes, once before, and here,
      a night in March, the night Gino and Lilia had told her of their love&mdash;the
      night whose evil she had come now to undo.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a sudden cry of shame. &ldquo;This time&mdash;the same place&mdash;the
      same thing&rdquo;&mdash;and she began to beat down her happiness, knowing it to
      be sinful. She was here to fight against this place, to rescue a little
      soul&mdash;who was innocent as yet. She was here to champion morality and
      purity, and the holy life of an English home. In the spring she had sinned
      through ignorance; she was not ignorant now. &ldquo;Help me!&rdquo; she cried, and
      shut the window as if there was magic in the encircling air. But the tunes
      would not go out of her head, and all night long she was troubled by
      torrents of music, and by applause and laughter, and angry young men who
      shouted the distich out of Baedeker:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Poggibonizzi fatti in la,
  Che Monteriano si fa citta!
</pre>
    <p>
      Poggibonsi was revealed to her as they sang&mdash;a joyless, straggling
      place, full of people who pretended. When she woke up she knew that it had
      been Sawston.

      Chapter 7
    </h2>
    <p>
      At about nine o&rsquo;clock next morning Perfetta went out on to the loggia, not
      to look at the view, but to throw some dirty water at it. &ldquo;Scusi tanto!&rdquo;
       she wailed, for the water spattered a tall young lady who had for some
      time been tapping at the lower door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Signor Carella in?&rdquo; the young lady asked. It was no business of
      Perfetta&rsquo;s to be shocked, and the style of the visitor seemed to demand
      the reception-room. Accordingly she opened its shutters, dusted a round
      patch on one of the horsehair chairs, and bade the lady do herself the
      inconvenience of sitting down. Then she ran into Monteriano and shouted up
      and down its streets until such time as her young master should hear her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reception-room was sacred to the dead wife. Her shiny portrait hung
      upon the wall&mdash;similar, doubtless, in all respects to the one which
      would be pasted on her tombstone. A little piece of black drapery had been
      tacked above the frame to lend a dignity to woe. But two of the tacks had
      fallen out, and the effect was now rakish, as of a drunkard&rsquo;s bonnet. A
      coon song lay open on the piano, and of the two tables one supported
      Baedeker&rsquo;s &ldquo;Central Italy,&rdquo; the other Harriet&rsquo;s inlaid box. And over
      everything there lay a deposit of heavy white dust, which was only blown
      off one moment to thicken on another. It is well to be remembered with
      love. It is not so very dreadful to be forgotten entirely. But if we shall
      resent anything on earth at all, we shall resent the consecration of a
      deserted room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Abbott did not sit down, partly because the antimacassars might
      harbour fleas, partly because she had suddenly felt faint, and was glad to
      cling on to the funnel of the stove. She struggled with herself, for she
      had need to be very calm; only if she was very calm might her behaviour be
      justified. She had broken faith with Philip and Harriet: she was going to
      try for the baby before they did. If she failed she could scarcely look
      them in the face again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harriet and her brother,&rdquo; she reasoned, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t realize what is before
      them. She would bluster and be rude; he would be pleasant and take it as a
      joke. Both of them&mdash;even if they offered money&mdash;would fail. But
      I begin to understand the man&rsquo;s nature; he does not love the child, but he
      will be touchy about it&mdash;and that is quite as bad for us. He&rsquo;s
      charming, but he&rsquo;s no fool; he conquered me last year; he conquered Mr.
      Herriton yesterday, and if I am not careful he will conquer us all today,
      and the baby will grow up in Monteriano. He is terribly strong; Lilia
      found that out, but only I remember it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This attempt, and this justification of it, were the results of the long
      and restless night. Miss Abbott had come to believe that she alone could
      do battle with Gino, because she alone understood him; and she had put
      this, as nicely as she could, in a note which she had left for Philip. It
      distressed her to write such a note, partly because her education inclined
      her to reverence the male, partly because she had got to like Philip a
      good deal after their last strange interview. His pettiness would be
      dispersed, and as for his &ldquo;unconventionality,&rdquo; which was so much gossiped
      about at Sawston, she began to see that it did not differ greatly from
      certain familiar notions of her own. If only he would forgive her for what
      she was doing now, there might perhaps be before them a long and
      profitable friendship. But she must succeed. No one would forgive her if
      she did not succeed. She prepared to do battle with the powers of evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of her adversary was heard at last, singing fearlessly from his
      expanded lungs, like a professional. Herein he differed from Englishmen,
      who always have a little feeling against music, and sing only from the
      throat, apologetically. He padded upstairs, and looked in at the open door
      of the reception-room without seeing her. Her heart leapt and her throat
      was dry when he turned away and passed, still singing, into the room
      opposite. It is alarming not to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had left the door of this room open, and she could see into it, right
      across the landing. It was in a shocking mess. Food, bedclothes,
      patent-leather boots, dirty plates, and knives lay strewn over a large
      table and on the floor. But it was the mess that comes of life, not of
      desolation. It was preferable to the charnel-chamber in which she was
      standing now, and the light in it was soft and large, as from some
      gracious, noble opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped singing, and cried &ldquo;Where is Perfetta?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His back was turned, and he was lighting a cigar. He was not speaking to
      Miss Abbott. He could not even be expecting her. The vista of the landing
      and the two open doors made him both remote and significant, like an actor
      on the stage, intimate and unapproachable at the same time. She could no
      more call out to him than if he was Hamlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know!&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;but you will not tell me. Exactly like you.&rdquo; He
      reclined on the table and blew a fat smoke-ring. &ldquo;And why won&rsquo;t you tell
      me the numbers? I have dreamt of a red hen&mdash;that is two hundred and
      five, and a friend unexpected&mdash;he means eighty-two. But I try for the
      Terno this week. So tell me another number.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Abbott did not know of the Tombola. His speech terrified her. She
      felt those subtle restrictions which come upon us in fatigue. Had she
      slept well she would have greeted him as soon as she saw him. Now it was
      impossible. He had got into another world.
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched his smoke-ring. The air had carried it slowly away from him,
      and brought it out intact upon the landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hundred and five&mdash;eighty-two. In any case I shall put them on
      Bari, not on Florence. I cannot tell you why; I have a feeling this week
      for Bari.&rdquo; Again she tried to speak. But the ring mesmerized her. It had
      become vast and elliptical, and floated in at the reception-room door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you don&rsquo;t care if you get the profits. You won&rsquo;t even say &lsquo;Thank you,
      Gino.&rsquo; Say it, or I&rsquo;ll drop hot, red-hot ashes on you. &lsquo;Thank you, Gino&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ring had extended its pale blue coils towards her. She lost
      self-control. It enveloped her. As if it was a breath from the pit, she
      screamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he was, wanting to know what had frightened her, how she had got
      here, why she had never spoken. He made her sit down. He brought her wine,
      which she refused. She had not one word to say to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;What has frightened you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He, too, was frightened, and perspiration came starting through the tan.
      For it is a serious thing to have been watched. We all radiate something
      curiously intimate when we believe ourselves to be alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business&mdash;&rdquo; she said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most important business.&rdquo; She was lying, white and limp, in the dusty
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before business you must get well; this is the best wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She refused it feebly. He poured out a glass. She drank it. As she did so
      she became self-conscious. However important the business, it was not
      proper of her to have called on him, or to accept his hospitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you are engaged,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And as I am not very well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not well enough to go back. And I am not engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked nervously at the other room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, now I understand,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Now I see what frightened you. But
      why did you never speak?&rdquo; And taking her into the room where he lived, he
      pointed to&mdash;the baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had thought so much about this baby, of its welfare, its soul, its
      morals, its probable defects. But, like most unmarried people, she had
      only thought of it as a word&mdash;just as the healthy man only thinks of
      the word death, not of death itself. The real thing, lying asleep on a
      dirty rug, disconcerted her. It did not stand for a principle any longer.
      It was so much flesh and blood, so many inches and ounces of life&mdash;a
      glorious, unquestionable fact, which a man and another woman had given to
      the world. You could talk to it; in time it would answer you; in time it
      would not answer you unless it chose, but would secrete, within the
      compass of its body, thoughts and wonderful passions of its own. And this
      was the machine on which she and Mrs. Herriton and Philip and Harriet had
      for the last month been exercising their various ideals&mdash;had
      determined that in time it should move this way or that way, should
      accomplish this and not that. It was to be Low Church, it was to be
      high-principled, it was to be tactful, gentlemanly, artistic&mdash;excellent
      things all. Yet now that she saw this baby, lying asleep on a dirty rug,
      she had a great disposition not to dictate one of them, and to exert no
      more influence than there may be in a kiss or in the vaguest of the
      heartfelt prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had practised self-discipline, and her thoughts and actions were
      not yet to correspond. To recover her self-esteem she tried to imagine
      that she was in her district, and to behave accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fine child, Signor Carella. And how nice of you to talk to it.
      Though I see that the ungrateful little fellow is asleep! Seven months?
      No, eight; of course eight. Still, he is a remarkably fine child for his
      age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Italian is a bad medium for condescension. The patronizing words came out
      gracious and sincere, and he smiled with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not stand. Let us sit on the loggia, where it is cool. I am
      afraid the room is very untidy,&rdquo; he added, with the air of a hostess who
      apologizes for a stray thread on the drawing-room carpet. Miss Abbott
      picked her way to the chair. He sat near her, astride the parapet, with
      one foot in the loggia and the other dangling into the view. His face was
      in profile, and its beautiful contours drove artfully against the misty
      green of the opposing hills. &ldquo;Posing!&rdquo; said Miss Abbott to herself. &ldquo;A
      born artist&rsquo;s model.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Herriton called yesterday,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;but you were out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started an elaborate and graceful explanation. He had gone for the day
      to Poggibonsi. Why had the Herritons not written to him, so that he could
      have received them properly? Poggibonsi would have done any day; not but
      what his business there was fairly important. What did she suppose that it
      was?
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally she was not greatly interested. She had not come from Sawston to
      guess why he had been to Poggibonsi. She answered politely that she had no
      idea, and returned to her mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But guess!&rdquo; he persisted, clapping the balustrade between his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      She suggested, with gentle sarcasm, that perhaps he had gone to Poggibonsi
      to find something to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      He intimated that it was not as important as all that. Something to do&mdash;an
      almost hopeless quest! &ldquo;E manca questo!&rdquo; He rubbed his thumb and
      forefinger together, to indicate that he had no money. Then he sighed, and
      blew another smoke-ring. Miss Abbott took heart and turned diplomatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This house,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is a large house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; was his gloomy reply. &ldquo;And when my poor wife died&mdash;&rdquo; He
      got up, went in, and walked across the landing to the reception-room door,
      which he closed reverently. Then he shut the door of the living-room with
      his foot, returned briskly to his seat, and continued his sentence. &ldquo;When
      my poor wife died I thought of having my relatives to live here. My father
      wished to give up his practice at Empoli; my mother and sisters and two
      aunts were also willing. But it was impossible. They have their ways of
      doing things, and when I was younger I was content with them. But now I am
      a man. I have my own ways. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; said Miss Abbott, thinking of her own dear father, whose
      tricks and habits, after twenty-five years spent in their company, were
      beginning to get on her nerves. She remembered, though, that she was not
      here to sympathize with Gino&mdash;at all events, not to show that she
      sympathized. She also reminded herself that he was not worthy of sympathy.
      &ldquo;It is a large house,&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immense; and the taxes! But it will be better when&mdash;Ah! but you have
      never guessed why I went to Poggibonsi&mdash;why it was that I was out
      when he called.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot guess, Signor Carella. I am here on business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot; I hardly know you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we are old friends,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and your approval will be grateful to
      me. You gave it me once before. Will you give it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not come as a friend this time,&rdquo; she answered stiffly. &ldquo;I am not
      likely, Signor Carella, to approve of anything you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Signorina!&rdquo; He laughed, as if he found her piquant and amusing.
      &ldquo;Surely you approve of marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where there is love,&rdquo; said Miss Abbott, looking at him hard. His face had
      altered in the last year, but not for the worse, which was baffling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where there is love,&rdquo; said he, politely echoing the English view. Then he
      smiled on her, expecting congratulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I understand that you are proposing to marry again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forbid you, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked puzzled, but took it for some foreign banter, and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forbid you!&rdquo; repeated Miss Abbott, and all the indignation of her sex
      and her nationality went thrilling through the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo; He jumped up, frowning. His voice was squeaky and petulant,
      like that of a child who is suddenly forbidden a toy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have ruined one woman; I forbid you to ruin another. It is not a year
      since Lilia died. You pretended to me the other day that you loved her. It
      is a lie. You wanted her money. Has this woman money too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes!&rdquo; he said irritably. &ldquo;A little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I suppose you will say that you love her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not say it. It will be untrue. Now my poor wife&mdash;&rdquo; He
      stopped, seeing that the comparison would involve him in difficulties. And
      indeed he had often found Lilia as agreeable as any one else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Abbott was furious at this final insult to her dead acquaintance. She
      was glad that after all she could be so angry with the boy. She glowed and
      throbbed; her tongue moved nimbly. At the finish, if the real business of
      the day had been completed, she could have swept majestically from the
      house. But the baby still remained, asleep on a dirty rug.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gino was thoughtful, and stood scratching his head. He respected Miss
      Abbott. He wished that she would respect him. &ldquo;So you do not advise me?&rdquo;
       he said dolefully. &ldquo;But why should it be a failure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Abbott tried to remember that he was really a child still&mdash;a
      child with the strength and the passions of a disreputable man. &ldquo;How can
      it succeed,&rdquo; she said solemnly, &ldquo;where there is no love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she does love me! I forgot to tell you that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Passionately.&rdquo; He laid his hand upon his own heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then God help her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stamped impatiently. &ldquo;Whatever I say displeases you, Signorina. God
      help you, for you are most unfair. You say that I ill-treated my dear
      wife. It is not so. I have never ill-treated any one. You complain that
      there is no love in this marriage. I prove that there is, and you become
      still more angry. What do you want? Do you suppose she will not be
      contented? Glad enough she is to get me, and she will do her duty well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her duty!&rdquo; cried Miss Abbott, with all the bitterness of which she was
      capable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course. She knows why I am marrying her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To succeed where Lilia failed! To be your housekeeper, your slave, you&mdash;&rdquo;
       The words she would like to have said were too violent for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To look after the baby, certainly,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The baby&mdash;?&rdquo; She had forgotten it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an English marriage,&rdquo; he said proudly. &ldquo;I do not care about the
      money. I am having her for my son. Did you not understand that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Miss Abbott, utterly bewildered. Then, for a moment, she saw
      light. &ldquo;It is not necessary, Signor Carella. Since you are tired of the
      baby&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ever after she remembered it to her credit that she saw her mistake at
      once. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; she added quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; was his courteous response. &ldquo;Ah, in a foreign language (and how
      perfectly you speak Italian) one is certain to make slips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at his face. It was apparently innocent of satire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You meant that we could not always be together yet, he and I. You are
      right. What is to be done? I cannot afford a nurse, and Perfetta is too
      rough. When he was ill I dare not let her touch him. When he has to be
      washed, which happens now and then, who does it? I. I feed him, or settle
      what he shall have. I sleep with him and comfort him when he is unhappy in
      the night. No one talks, no one may sing to him but I. Do not be unfair
      this time; I like to do these things. But nevertheless (his voice became
      pathetic) they take up a great deal of time, and are not all suitable for
      a young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all suitable,&rdquo; said Miss Abbott, and closed her eyes wearily. Each
      moment her difficulties were increasing. She wished that she was not so
      tired, so open to contradictory impressions. She longed for Harriet&rsquo;s
      burly obtuseness or for the soulless diplomacy of Mrs. Herriton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little more wine?&rdquo; asked Gino kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, thank you! But marriage, Signor Carella, is a very serious step.
      Could you not manage more simply? Your relative, for example&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Empoli! I would as soon have him in England!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;England, then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has a grandmother there, you know&mdash;Mrs. Theobald.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has a grandmother here. No, he is troublesome, but I must have him
      with me. I will not even have my father and mother too. For they would
      separate us,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would separate our thoughts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent. This cruel, vicious fellow knew of strange refinements.
      The horrible truth, that wicked people are capable of love, stood naked
      before her, and her moral being was abashed. It was her duty to rescue the
      baby, to save it from contagion, and she still meant to do her duty. But
      the comfortable sense of virtue left her. She was in the presence of
      something greater than right or wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forgetting that this was an interview, he had strolled back into the room,
      driven by the instinct she had aroused in him. &ldquo;Wake up!&rdquo; he cried to his
      baby, as if it was some grown-up friend. Then he lifted his foot and trod
      lightly on its stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Abbott cried, &ldquo;Oh, take care!&rdquo; She was unaccustomed to this method of
      awakening the young.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not much longer than my boot, is he? Can you believe that in time
      his own boots will be as large? And that he also&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But ought you to treat him like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood with one foot resting on the little body, suddenly musing, filled
      with the desire that his son should be like him, and should have sons like
      him, to people the earth. It is the strongest desire that can come to a
      man&mdash;if it comes to him at all&mdash;stronger even than love or the
      desire for personal immortality. All men vaunt it, and declare that it is
      theirs; but the hearts of most are set elsewhere. It is the exception who
      comprehends that physical and spiritual life may stream out of him for
      ever. Miss Abbott, for all her goodness, could not comprehend it, though
      such a thing is more within the comprehension of women. And when Gino
      pointed first to himself and then to his baby and said &ldquo;father-son,&rdquo; she
      still took it as a piece of nursery prattle, and smiled mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child, the first fruits, woke up and glared at her. Gino did not greet
      it, but continued the exposition of his policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This woman will do exactly what I tell her. She is fond of children. She
      is clean; she has a pleasant voice. She is not beautiful; I cannot pretend
      that to you for a moment. But she is what I require.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baby gave a piercing yell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do take care!&rdquo; begged Miss Abbott. &ldquo;You are squeezing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing. If he cries silently then you may be frightened. He thinks
      I am going to wash him, and he is quite right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wash him!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You? Here?&rdquo; The homely piece of news seemed to
      shatter all her plans. She had spent a long half-hour in elaborate
      approaches, in high moral attacks; she had neither frightened her enemy
      nor made him angry, nor interfered with the least detail of his domestic
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had gone to the Farmacia,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and was sitting there
      comfortably, when suddenly I remembered that Perfetta had heated water an
      hour ago&mdash;over there, look, covered with a cushion. I came away at
      once, for really he must be washed. You must excuse me. I can put it off
      no longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have wasted your time,&rdquo; she said feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked sternly to the loggia and drew from it a large earthenware bowl.
      It was dirty inside; he dusted it with a tablecloth. Then he fetched the
      hot water, which was in a copper pot. He poured it out. He added cold. He
      felt in his pocket and brought out a piece of soap. Then he took up the
      baby, and, holding his cigar between his teeth, began to unwrap it. Miss
      Abbott turned to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why are you going? Excuse me if I wash him while we talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing more to say,&rdquo; said Miss Abbott. All she could do now was
      to find Philip, confess her miserable defeat, and bid him go in her stead
      and prosper better. She cursed her feebleness; she longed to expose it,
      without apologies or tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but stop a moment!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You have not seen him yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen as much as I want, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last wrapping slid off. He held out to her in his two hands a little
      kicking image of bronze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She would not touch the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go at once,&rdquo; she cried; for the tears&mdash;the wrong tears&mdash;were
      hurrying to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who would have believed his mother was blonde? For he is brown all over&mdash;brown
      every inch of him. Ah, but how beautiful he is! And he is mine; mine for
      ever. Even if he hates me he will be mine. He cannot help it; he is made
      out of me; I am his father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was too late to go. She could not tell why, but it was too late. She
      turned away her head when Gino lifted his son to his lips. This was
      something too remote from the prettiness of the nursery. The man was
      majestic; he was a part of Nature; in no ordinary love scene could he ever
      be so great. For a wonderful physical tie binds the parents to the
      children; and&mdash;by some sad, strange irony&mdash;it does not bind us
      children to our parents. For if it did, if we could answer their love not
      with gratitude but with equal love, life would lose much of its pathos and
      much of its squalor, and we might be wonderfully happy. Gino passionately
      embracing, Miss Abbott reverently averting her eyes&mdash;both of them had
      parents whom they did not love so very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I help you to wash him?&rdquo; she asked humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave her his son without speaking, and they knelt side by side, tucking
      up their sleeves. The child had stopped crying, and his arms and legs were
      agitated by some overpowering joy. Miss Abbott had a woman&rsquo;s pleasure in
      cleaning anything&mdash;more especially when the thing was human. She
      understood little babies from long experience in a district, and Gino soon
      ceased to give her directions, and only gave her thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very kind of you,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;especially in your beautiful
      dress. He is nearly clean already. Why, I take the whole morning! There is
      so much more of a baby than one expects. And Perfetta washes him just as
      she washes clothes. Then he screams for hours. My wife is to have a light
      hand. Ah, how he kicks! Has he splashed you? I am very sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready for a soft towel now,&rdquo; said Miss Abbott, who was strangely
      exalted by the service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly! certainly!&rdquo; He strode in a knowing way to a cupboard. But he
      had no idea where the soft towel was. Generally he dabbed the baby on the
      first dry thing he found.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you had any powder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He struck his forehead despairingly. Apparently the stock of powder was
      just exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sacrificed her own clean handkerchief. He put a chair for her on the
      loggia, which faced westward, and was still pleasant and cool. There she
      sat, with twenty miles of view behind her, and he placed the dripping baby
      on her knee. It shone now with health and beauty: it seemed to reflect
      light, like a copper vessel. Just such a baby Bellini sets languid on his
      mother&rsquo;s lap, or Signorelli flings wriggling on pavements of marble, or
      Lorenzo di Credi, more reverent but less divine, lays carefully among
      flowers, with his head upon a wisp of golden straw. For a time Gino
      contemplated them standing. Then, to get a better view, he knelt by the
      side of the chair, with his hands clasped before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they were when Philip entered, and saw, to all intents and purposes,
      the Virgin and Child, with Donor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; he exclaimed; for he was glad to find things in such cheerful
      trim.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not greet him, but rose up unsteadily and handed the baby to his
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, do stop!&rdquo; whispered Philip. &ldquo;I got your note. I&rsquo;m not offended;
      you&rsquo;re quite right. I really want you; I could never have done it alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No words came from her, but she raised her hands to her mouth, like one
      who is in sudden agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signorina, do stop a little&mdash;after all your kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Philip kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to speak, and then went away weeping bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men stared at each other. By a common impulse they ran on to the
      loggia. They were just in time to see Miss Abbott disappear among the
      trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Philip again. There was no answer, and somehow he did
      not want an answer. Some strange thing had happened which he could not
      presume to understand. He would find out from Miss Abbott, if ever he
      found out at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, your business,&rdquo; said Gino, after a puzzled sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our business&mdash;Miss Abbott has told you of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She came for business. But she forgot about it; so did I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perfetta, who had a genius for missing people, now returned, loudly
      complaining of the size of Monteriano and the intricacies of its streets.
      Gino told her to watch the baby. Then he offered Philip a cigar, and they
      proceeded to the business.

    <h2>
      Chapter 8
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;Mad!&rdquo; screamed Harriet,&mdash;&ldquo;absolutely stark, staring, raving mad!&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      Philip judged it better not to contradict her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s she here for? Answer me that. What&rsquo;s she doing in Monteriano in
      August? Why isn&rsquo;t she in Normandy? Answer that. She won&rsquo;t. I can: she&rsquo;s
      come to thwart us; she&rsquo;s betrayed us&mdash;got hold of mother&rsquo;s plans. Oh,
      goodness, my head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was unwise enough to reply, &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t accuse her of that. Though she
      is exasperating, she hasn&rsquo;t come here to betray us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why has she come here? Answer me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no answer. But fortunately his sister was too much agitated to
      wait for one. &ldquo;Bursting in on me&mdash;crying and looking a disgusting
      sight&mdash;and says she has been to see the Italian. Couldn&rsquo;t even talk
      properly; pretended she had changed her opinions. What are her opinions to
      us? I was very calm. I said: &lsquo;Miss Abbott, I think there is a little
      misapprehension in this matter. My mother, Mrs. Herriton&mdash;&rsquo; Oh,
      goodness, my head! Of course you&rsquo;ve failed&mdash;don&rsquo;t trouble to answer&mdash;I
      know you&rsquo;ve failed. Where&rsquo;s the baby, pray? Of course you haven&rsquo;t got it.
      Dear sweet Caroline won&rsquo;t let you. Oh, yes, and we&rsquo;re to go away at once
      and trouble the father no more. Those are her commands. Commands!
      COMMANDS!&rdquo; And Harriet also burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip governed his temper. His sister was annoying, but quite reasonable
      in her indignation. Moreover, Miss Abbott had behaved even worse than she
      supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not got the baby, Harriet, but at the same time I haven&rsquo;t exactly
      failed. I and Signor Carella are to have another interview this afternoon,
      at the Caffe Garibaldi. He is perfectly reasonable and pleasant. Should
      you be disposed to come with me, you would find him quite willing to
      discuss things. He is desperately in want of money, and has no prospect of
      getting any. I discovered that. At the same time, he has a certain
      affection for the child.&rdquo; For Philip&rsquo;s insight, or perhaps his
      opportunities, had not been equal to Miss Abbott&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet would only sob, and accuse her brother of insulting her; how could
      a lady speak to such a horrible man? That, and nothing else, was enough to
      stamp Caroline. Oh, poor Lilia!
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip drummed on the bedroom window-sill. He saw no escape from the
      deadlock. For though he spoke cheerfully about his second interview with
      Gino, he felt at the bottom of his heart that it would fail. Gino was too
      courteous: he would not break off negotiations by sharp denial; he loved
      this civil, half-humorous bargaining. And he loved fooling his opponent,
      and did it so nicely that his opponent did not mind being fooled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Abbott has behaved extraordinarily,&rdquo; he said at last; &ldquo;but at the
      same time&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His sister would not hear him. She burst forth again on the madness, the
      interference, the intolerable duplicity of Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harriet, you must listen. My dear, you must stop crying. I have something
      quite important to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not stop crying,&rdquo; said she. But in time, finding that he would
      not speak to her, she did stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember that Miss Abbott has done us no harm. She said nothing to him
      about the matter. He assumes that she is working with us: I gathered
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but if you&rsquo;re careful she may be. I interpret her behaviour thus:
      She went to see him, honestly intending to get the child away. In the note
      she left me she says so, and I don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;d lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When she got there, there was some pretty domestic scene between him and
      the baby, and she has got swept off in a gush of sentimentalism. Before
      very long, if I know anything about psychology, there will be a reaction.
      She&rsquo;ll be swept back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand your long words. Say plainly&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When she&rsquo;s swept back, she&rsquo;ll be invaluable. For she has made quite an
      impression on him. He thinks her so nice with the baby. You know, she
      washed it for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disgusting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet&rsquo;s ejaculations were more aggravating than the rest of her. But
      Philip was averse to losing his temper. The access of joy that had come to
      him yesterday in the theatre promised to be permanent. He was more anxious
      than heretofore to be charitable towards the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want to carry off the baby, keep your peace with Miss Abbott. For
      if she chooses, she can help you better than I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can be no peace between me and her,&rdquo; said Harriet gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not all I wanted. She went away before I had finished speaking&mdash;just
      like those cowardly people!&mdash;into the church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into Santa Deodata&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;m sure she needs it. Anything more unchristian&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In time Philip went to the church also, leaving his sister a little calmer
      and a little disposed to think over his advice. What had come over Miss
      Abbott? He had always thought her both stable and sincere. That
      conversation he had had with her last Christmas in the train to Charing
      Cross&mdash;that alone furnished him with a parallel. For the second time,
      Monteriano must have turned her head. He was not angry with her, for he
      was quite indifferent to the outcome of their expedition. He was only
      extremely interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now nearly midday, and the streets were clearing. But the intense
      heat had broken, and there was a pleasant suggestion of rain. The Piazza,
      with its three great attractions&mdash;the Palazzo Pubblico, the
      Collegiate Church, and the Caffe Garibaldi: the intellect, the soul, and
      the body&mdash;had never looked more charming. For a moment Philip stood
      in its centre, much inclined to be dreamy, and thinking how wonderful it
      must feel to belong to a city, however mean. He was here, however, as an
      emissary of civilization and as a student of character, and, after a sigh,
      he entered Santa Deodata&rsquo;s to continue his mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been a FESTA two days before, and the church still smelt of
      incense and of garlic. The little son of the sacristan was sweeping the
      nave, more for amusement than for cleanliness, sending great clouds of
      dust over the frescoes and the scattered worshippers. The sacristan
      himself had propped a ladder in the centre of the Deluge&mdash;which fills
      one of the nave spandrels&mdash;and was freeing a column from its wealth
      of scarlet calico. Much scarlet calico also lay upon the floor&mdash;for
      the church can look as fine as any theatre&mdash;and the sacristan&rsquo;s
      little daughter was trying to fold it up. She was wearing a tinsel crown.
      The crown really belonged to St. Augustine. But it had been cut too big:
      it fell down over his cheeks like a collar: you never saw anything so
      absurd. One of the canons had unhooked it just before the FIESTA began,
      and had given it to the sacristan&rsquo;s daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please,&rdquo; cried Philip, &ldquo;is there an English lady here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s mouth was full of tin-tacks, but he nodded cheerfully towards a
      kneeling figure. In the midst of this confusion Miss Abbott was praying.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not much surprised: a spiritual breakdown was quite to be expected.
      For though he was growing more charitable towards mankind, he was still a
      little jaunty, and too apt to stake out beforehand the course that will be
      pursued by the wounded soul. It did not surprise him, however, that she
      should greet him naturally, with none of the sour self-consciousness of a
      person who had just risen from her knees. This was indeed the spirit of
      Santa Deodata&rsquo;s, where a prayer to God is thought none the worse of
      because it comes next to a pleasant word to a neighbour. &ldquo;I am sure that I
      need it,&rdquo; said she; and he, who had expected her to be ashamed, became
      confused, and knew not what to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing to tell you,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I have simply changed straight
      round. If I had planned the whole thing out, I could not have treated you
      worse. I can talk it over now; but please believe that I have been
      crying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And please believe that I have not come to scold you,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;I
      know what has happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Miss Abbott. Instinctively she led the way to the famous
      chapel, the fifth chapel on the right, wherein Giovanni da Empoli has
      painted the death and burial of the saint. Here they could sit out of the
      dust and the noise, and proceed with a discussion which promised to be
      important.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What might have happened to me&mdash;he had made you believe that he
      loved the child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; he has. He will never give it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At present it is still unsettled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will never be settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not. Well, as I said, I know what has happened, and I am not here
      to scold you. But I must ask you to withdraw from the thing for the
      present. Harriet is furious. But she will calm down when she realizes that
      you have done us no harm, and will do none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can do no more,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I tell you plainly I have changed
      sides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do no more, that is all we want. You promise not to prejudice our
      cause by speaking to Signor Carella?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly. I don&rsquo;t want to speak to him again; I shan&rsquo;t ever see him
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite nice, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all I wanted to know. I&rsquo;ll go and tell Harriet of your
      promise, and I think things&rsquo;ll quiet down now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he did not move, for it was an increasing pleasure to him to be near
      her, and her charm was at its strongest today. He thought less of
      psychology and feminine reaction. The gush of sentimentalism which had
      carried her away had only made her more alluring. He was content to
      observe her beauty and to profit by the tenderness and the wisdom that
      dwelt within her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you angry with me?&rdquo; she asked, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I understand you&mdash;all sides, I think,&mdash;Harriet, Signor
      Carella, even my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do understand wonderfully. You are the only one of us who has a
      general view of the muddle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled with pleasure. It was the first time she had ever praised him.
      His eyes rested agreeably on Santa Deodata, who was dying in full
      sanctity, upon her back. There was a window open behind her, revealing
      just such a view as he had seen that morning, and on her widowed mother&rsquo;s
      dresser there stood just such another copper pot. The saint looked neither
      at the view nor at the pot, and at her widowed mother still less. For lo!
      she had a vision: the head and shoulders of St. Augustine were sliding
      like some miraculous enamel along the rough-cast wall. It is a gentle
      saint who is content with half another saint to see her die. In her death,
      as in her life, Santa Deodata did not accomplish much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So what are you going to do?&rdquo; said Miss Abbott.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip started, not so much at the words as at the sudden change in the
      voice. &ldquo;Do?&rdquo; he echoed, rather dismayed. &ldquo;This afternoon I have another
      interview.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will come to nothing. Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then another. If that fails I shall wire home for instructions. I dare
      say we may fail altogether, but we shall fail honourably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had often been decided. But now behind her decision there was a note
      of passion. She struck him not as different, but as more important, and he
      minded it very much when she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not doing anything! You would be doing something if you kidnapped
      the baby, or if you went straight away. But that! To fail honourably! To
      come out of the thing as well as you can! Is that all you are after?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;Since we talk openly, that is all I am after
      just now. What else is there? If I can persuade Signor Carella to give in,
      so much the better. If he won&rsquo;t, I must report the failure to my mother
      and then go home. Why, Miss Abbott, you can&rsquo;t expect me to follow you
      through all these turns&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t! But I do expect you to settle what is right and to follow that.
      Do you want the child to stop with his father, who loves him and will
      bring him up badly, or do you want him to come to Sawston, where no one
      loves him, but where he will be brought up well? There is the question put
      dispassionately enough even for you. Settle it. Settle which side you&rsquo;ll
      fight on. But don&rsquo;t go talking about an &lsquo;honourable failure,&rsquo; which means
      simply not thinking and not acting at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I understand the position of Signor Carella and of you, it&rsquo;s no
      reason that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None at all. Fight as if you think us wrong. Oh, what&rsquo;s the use of your
      fair-mindedness if you never decide for yourself? Any one gets hold of you
      and makes you do what they want. And you see through them and laugh at
      them&mdash;and do it. It&rsquo;s not enough to see clearly; I&rsquo;m muddle-headed
      and stupid, and not worth a quarter of you, but I have tried to do what
      seemed right at the time. And you&mdash;your brain and your insight are
      splendid. But when you see what&rsquo;s right you&rsquo;re too idle to do it. You told
      me once that we shall be judged by our intentions, not by our
      accomplishments. I thought it a grand remark. But we must intend to
      accomplish&mdash;not sit intending on a chair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wonderful!&rdquo; he said gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you appreciate me!&rdquo; she burst out again. &ldquo;I wish you didn&rsquo;t. You
      appreciate us all&mdash;see good in all of us. And all the time you are
      dead&mdash;dead&mdash;dead. Look, why aren&rsquo;t you angry?&rdquo; She came up to
      him, and then her mood suddenly changed, and she took hold of both his
      hands. &ldquo;You are so splendid, Mr. Herriton, that I can&rsquo;t bear to see you
      wasted. I can&rsquo;t bear&mdash;she has not been good to you&mdash;your
      mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Abbott, don&rsquo;t worry over me. Some people are born not to do things.
      I&rsquo;m one of them; I never did anything at school or at the Bar. I came out
      to stop Lilia&rsquo;s marriage, and it was too late. I came out intending to get
      the baby, and I shall return an &lsquo;honourable failure.&rsquo; I never expect
      anything to happen now, and so I am never disappointed. You would be
      surprised to know what my great events are. Going to the theatre
      yesterday, talking to you now&mdash;I don&rsquo;t suppose I shall ever meet
      anything greater. I seem fated to pass through the world without colliding
      with it or moving it&mdash;and I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t tell you whether the
      fate&rsquo;s good or evil. I don&rsquo;t die&mdash;I don&rsquo;t fall in love. And if other
      people die or fall in love they always do it when I&rsquo;m just not there. You
      are quite right; life to me is just a spectacle, which&mdash;thank God,
      and thank Italy, and thank you&mdash;is now more beautiful and heartening
      than it has ever been before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said solemnly, &ldquo;I wish something would happen to you, my dear friend;
      I wish something would happen to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo; he asked, smiling. &ldquo;Prove to me why I don&rsquo;t do as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She also smiled, very gravely. She could not prove it. No argument
      existed. Their discourse, splendid as it had been, resulted in nothing,
      and their respective opinions and policies were exactly the same when they
      left the church as when they had entered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet was rude at lunch. She called Miss Abbott a turncoat and a coward
      to her face. Miss Abbott resented neither epithet, feeling that one was
      justified and the other not unreasonable. She tried to avoid even the
      suspicion of satire in her replies. But Harriet was sure that she was
      satirical because she was so calm. She got more and more violent, and
      Philip at one time feared that she would come to blows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; he cried, with something of the old manner, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too hot for
      this. We&rsquo;ve been talking and interviewing each other all the morning, and
      I have another interview this afternoon. I do stipulate for silence. Let
      each lady retire to her bedroom with a book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I retire to pack,&rdquo; said Harriet. &ldquo;Please remind Signor Carella, Philip,
      that the baby is to be here by half-past eight this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly, Harriet. I shall make a point of reminding him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And order a carriage to take us to the evening train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And please,&rdquo; said Miss Abbott, &ldquo;would you order a carriage for me too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You going?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she replied, suddenly flushing. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course you would be going. Two carriages, then. Two carriages for
      the evening train.&rdquo; He looked at his sister hopelessly. &ldquo;Harriet, whatever
      are you up to? We shall never be ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order my carriage for the evening train,&rdquo; said Harriet, and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose I shall. And I shall also have my interview with Signor
      Carella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Abbott gave a little sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should you mind? Do you suppose that I shall have the slightest
      influence over him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But&mdash;I can&rsquo;t repeat all that I said in the church. You ought
      never to see him again. You ought to bundle Harriet into a carriage, not
      this evening, but now, and drive her straight away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I ought. But it isn&rsquo;t a very big &lsquo;ought.&rsquo; Whatever Harriet and I
      do the issue is the same. Why, I can see the splendour of it&mdash;even
      the humour. Gino sitting up here on the mountain-top with his cub. We come
      and ask for it. He welcomes us. We ask for it again. He is equally
      pleasant. I&rsquo;m agreeable to spend the whole week bargaining with him. But I
      know that at the end of it I shall descend empty-handed to the plains. It
      might be finer of me to make up my mind. But I&rsquo;m not a fine character. And
      nothing hangs on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I am extreme,&rdquo; she said humbly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to run you,
      just like your mother. I feel you ought to fight it out with Harriet.
      Every little trifle, for some reason, does seem incalculably important
      today, and when you say of a thing that &lsquo;nothing hangs on it,&rsquo; it sounds
      like blasphemy. There&rsquo;s never any knowing&mdash;(how am I to put it?)&mdash;which
      of our actions, which of our idlenesses won&rsquo;t have things hanging on it
      for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He assented, but her remark had only an aesthetic value. He was not
      prepared to take it to his heart. All the afternoon he rested&mdash;worried,
      but not exactly despondent. The thing would jog out somehow. Probably Miss
      Abbott was right. The baby had better stop where it was loved. And that,
      probably, was what the fates had decreed. He felt little interest in the
      matter, and he was sure that he had no influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not surprising, therefore, that the interview at the Caffe
      Garibaldi came to nothing. Neither of them took it very seriously. And
      before long Gino had discovered how things lay, and was ragging his
      companion hopelessly. Philip tried to look offended, but in the end he had
      to laugh. &ldquo;Well, you are right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This affair is being managed by
      the ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the ladies&mdash;the ladies!&rdquo; cried the other, and then he roared
      like a millionaire for two cups of black coffee, and insisted on treating
      his friend, as a sign that their strife was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have done my best,&rdquo; said Philip, dipping a long slice of sugar
      into his cup, and watching the brown liquid ascend into it. &ldquo;I shall face
      my mother with a good conscience. Will you bear me witness that I&rsquo;ve done
      my best?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor fellow, I will!&rdquo; He laid a sympathetic hand on Philip&rsquo;s knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that I have&mdash;&rdquo; The sugar was now impregnated with coffee, and he
      bent forward to swallow it. As he did so his eyes swept the opposite of
      the Piazza, and he saw there, watching them, Harriet. &ldquo;Mia sorella!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed. Gino, much amused, laid his hand upon the little table, and
      beat the marble humorously with his fists. Harriet turned away and began
      gloomily to inspect the Palazzo Pubblico.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Harriet!&rdquo; said Philip, swallowing the sugar. &ldquo;One more wrench and it
      will all be over for her; we are leaving this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gino was sorry for this. &ldquo;Then you will not be here this evening as you
      promised us. All three leaving?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All three,&rdquo; said Philip, who had not revealed the secession of Miss
      Abbott; &ldquo;by the night train; at least, that is my sister&rsquo;s plan. So I&rsquo;m
      afraid I shan&rsquo;t be here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They watched the departing figure of Harriet, and then entered upon the
      final civilities. They shook each other warmly by both hands. Philip was
      to come again next year, and to write beforehand. He was to be introduced
      to Gino&rsquo;s wife, for he was told of the marriage now. He was to be
      godfather to his next baby. As for Gino, he would remember some time that
      Philip liked vermouth. He begged him to give his love to Irma. Mrs.
      Herriton&mdash;should he send her his sympathetic regards? No; perhaps
      that would hardly do.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the two young men parted with a good deal of genuine affection. For the
      barrier of language is sometimes a blessed barrier, which only lets pass
      what is good. Or&mdash;to put the thing less cynically&mdash;we may be
      better in new clean words, which have never been tainted by our pettiness
      or vice. Philip, at all events, lived more graciously in Italian, the very
      phrases of which entice one to be happy and kind. It was horrible to think
      of the English of Harriet, whose every word would be as hard, as distinct,
      and as unfinished as a lump of coal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet, however, talked little. She had seen enough to know that her
      brother had failed again, and with unwonted dignity she accepted the
      situation. She did her packing, she wrote up her diary, she made a brown
      paper cover for the new Baedeker. Philip, finding her so amenable, tried
      to discuss their future plans. But she only said that they would sleep in
      Florence, and told him to telegraph for rooms. They had supper alone. Miss
      Abbott did not come down. The landlady told them that Signor Carella had
      called on Miss Abbott to say good-bye, but she, though in, had not been
      able to see him. She also told them that it had begun to rain. Harriet
      sighed, but indicated to her brother that he was not responsible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriages came round at a quarter past eight. It was not raining much,
      but the night was extraordinarily dark, and one of the drivers wanted to
      go slowly to the station. Miss Abbott came down and said that she was
      ready, and would start at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; said Philip, who was standing in the hall. &ldquo;Now that we have
      quarrelled we scarcely want to travel in procession all the way down the
      hill. Well, good-bye; it&rsquo;s all over at last; another scene in my pageant
      has shifted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye; it&rsquo;s been a great pleasure to see you. I hope that won&rsquo;t shift,
      at all events.&rdquo; She gripped his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sound despondent,&rdquo; he said, laughing. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that you return
      victorious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I do,&rdquo; she replied, more despondently than ever, and got into
      the carriage. He concluded that she was thinking of her reception at
      Sawston, whither her fame would doubtless precede her. Whatever would Mrs.
      Herriton do? She could make things quite unpleasant when she thought it
      right. She might think it right to be silent, but then there was Harriet.
      Who would bridle Harriet&rsquo;s tongue? Between the two of them Miss Abbott was
      bound to have a bad time. Her reputation, both for consistency and for
      moral enthusiasm, would be lost for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard luck on her,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;She is a good person. I must do for
      her anything I can.&rdquo; Their intimacy had been very rapid, but he too hoped
      that it would not shift. He believed that he understood her, and that she,
      by now, had seen the worst of him. What if after a long time&mdash;if
      after all&mdash;he flushed like a boy as he looked after her carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into the dining-room to look for Harriet. Harriet was not to be
      found. Her bedroom, too, was empty. All that was left of her was the
      purple prayer-book which lay open on the bed. Philip took it up aimlessly,
      and saw&mdash;&ldquo;Blessed be the Lord my God who teacheth my hands to war and
      my fingers to fight.&rdquo; He put the book in his pocket, and began to brood
      over more profitable themes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Santa Deodata gave out half past eight. All the luggage was on, and still
      Harriet had not appeared. &ldquo;Depend upon it,&rdquo; said the landlady, &ldquo;she has
      gone to Signor Carella&rsquo;s to say good-bye to her little nephew.&rdquo; Philip did
      not think it likely. They shouted all over the house and still there was
      no Harriet. He began to be uneasy. He was helpless without Miss Abbott;
      her grave, kind face had cheered him wonderfully, even when it looked
      displeased. Monteriano was sad without her; the rain was thickening; the
      scraps of Donizetti floated tunelessly out of the wineshops, and of the
      great tower opposite he could only see the base, fresh papered with the
      advertisements of quacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man came up the street with a note. Philip read, &ldquo;Start at once. Pick me
      up outside the gate. Pay the bearer. H. H.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the lady give you this note?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was unintelligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak up!&rdquo; exclaimed Philip. &ldquo;Who gave it you&mdash;and where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing but horrible sighings and bubblings came out of the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be patient with him,&rdquo; said the driver, turning round on the box. &ldquo;It is
      the poor idiot.&rdquo; And the landlady came out of the hotel and echoed &ldquo;The
      poor idiot. He cannot speak. He takes messages for us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip then saw that the messenger was a ghastly creature, quite bald,
      with trickling eyes and grey twitching nose. In another country he would
      have been shut up; here he was accepted as a public institution, and part
      of Nature&rsquo;s scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; shuddered the Englishman. &ldquo;Signora padrona, find out from him; this
      note is from my sister. What does it mean? Where did he see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no good,&rdquo; said the landlady. &ldquo;He understands everything but he can
      explain nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has visions of the saints,&rdquo; said the man who drove the cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my sister&mdash;where has she gone? How has she met him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has gone for a walk,&rdquo; asserted the landlady. It was a nasty evening,
      but she was beginning to understand the English. &ldquo;She has gone for a walk&mdash;perhaps
      to wish good-bye to her little nephew. Preferring to come back another
      way, she has sent you this note by the poor idiot and is waiting for you
      outside the Siena gate. Many of my guests do this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing to do but to obey the message. He shook hands with the
      landlady, gave the messenger a nickel piece, and drove away. After a dozen
      yards the carriage stopped. The poor idiot was running and whimpering
      behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; cried Philip. &ldquo;I have paid him plenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A horrible hand pushed three soldi into his lap. It was part of the
      idiot&rsquo;s malady only to receive what was just for his services. This was
      the change out of the nickel piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; shouted Philip, and flung the money into the road. He was
      frightened at the episode; the whole of life had become unreal. It was a
      relief to be out of the Siena gate. They drew up for a moment on the
      terrace. But there was no sign of Harriet. The driver called to the Dogana
      men. But they had seen no English lady pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to do?&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;it is not like the lady to be late. We shall
      miss the train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us drive slowly,&rdquo; said the driver, &ldquo;and you shall call her by name as
      we go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they started down into the night, Philip calling &ldquo;Harriet! Harriet!
      Harriet!&rdquo; And there she was, waiting for them in the wet, at the first
      turn of the zigzag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harriet, why don&rsquo;t you answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you coming,&rdquo; said she, and got quickly in. Not till then did he
      see that she carried a bundle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush&mdash;sleeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet had succeeded where Miss Abbott and Philip had failed. It was the
      baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not let him talk. The baby, she repeated, was asleep, and she
      put up an umbrella to shield it and her from the rain. He should hear all
      later, so he had to conjecture the course of the wonderful interview&mdash;an
      interview between the South pole and the North. It was quite easy to
      conjecture: Gino crumpling up suddenly before the intense conviction of
      Harriet; being told, perhaps, to his face that he was a villain; yielding
      his only son perhaps for money, perhaps for nothing. &ldquo;Poor Gino,&rdquo; he
      thought. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s no greater than I am, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he thought of Miss Abbott, whose carriage must be descending the
      darkness some mile or two below them, and his easy self-accusation failed.
      She, too, had conviction; he had felt its force; he would feel it again
      when she knew this day&rsquo;s sombre and unexpected close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been pretty secret,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you might tell me a little now.
      What do we pay for him? All we&rsquo;ve got?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; answered Harriet, and dandled the bundle laboriously, like some
      bony prophetess&mdash;Judith, or Deborah, or Jael. He had last seen the
      baby sprawling on the knees of Miss Abbott, shining and naked, with twenty
      miles of view behind him, and his father kneeling by his feet. And that
      remembrance, together with Harriet, and the darkness, and the poor idiot,
      and the silent rain, filled him with sorrow and with the expectation of
      sorrow to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monteriano had long disappeared, and he could see nothing but the
      occasional wet stem of an olive, which their lamp illumined as they passed
      it. They travelled quickly, for this driver did not care how fast he went
      to the station, and would dash down each incline and scuttle perilously
      round the curves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Harriet,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;I feel bad; I want to see the
      baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind if I do wake him up. I want to see him. I&rsquo;ve as much right
      in him as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet gave in. But it was too dark for him to see the child&rsquo;s face.
      &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; he whispered, and before she could stop him he had lit a
      match under the shelter of her umbrella. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s awake!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
      The match went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good ickle quiet boysey, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip winced. &ldquo;His face, do you know, struck me as all wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All puckered queerly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course&mdash;with the shadows&mdash;you couldn&rsquo;t see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hold him up again.&rdquo; She did so. He lit another match. It went out
      quickly, but not before he had seen that the baby was crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Harriet sharply. &ldquo;We should hear him if he cried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s crying hard; I thought so before, and I&rsquo;m certain now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harriet touched the child&rsquo;s face. It was bathed in tears. &ldquo;Oh, the night
      air, I suppose,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;or perhaps the wet of the rain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, you haven&rsquo;t hurt it, or held it the wrong way, or anything; it is
      too uncanny&mdash;crying and no noise. Why didn&rsquo;t you get Perfetta to
      carry it to the hotel instead of muddling with the messenger? It&rsquo;s a
      marvel he understood about the note.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he understands.&rdquo; And he could feel her shudder. &ldquo;He tried to carry
      the baby&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why not Gino or Perfetta?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip, don&rsquo;t talk. Must I say it again? Don&rsquo;t talk. The baby wants to
      sleep.&rdquo; She crooned harshly as they descended, and now and then she wiped
      up the tears which welled inexhaustibly from the little eyes. Philip
      looked away, winking at times himself. It was as if they were travelling
      with the whole world&rsquo;s sorrow, as if all the mystery, all the persistency
      of woe were gathered to a single fount. The roads were now coated with
      mud, and the carriage went more quietly but not less swiftly, sliding by
      long zigzags into the night. He knew the landmarks pretty well: here was
      the crossroad to Poggibonsi; and the last view of Monteriano, if they had
      light, would be from here. Soon they ought to come to that little wood
      where violets were so plentiful in spring. He wished the weather had not
      changed; it was not cold, but the air was extraordinarily damp. It could
      not be good for the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he breathes, and all that sort of thing?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Harriet, in an angry whisper. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve started him again.
      I&rsquo;m certain he was asleep. I do wish you wouldn&rsquo;t talk; it makes me so
      nervous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m nervous too. I wish he&rsquo;d scream. It&rsquo;s too uncanny. Poor Gino! I&rsquo;m
      terribly sorry for Gino.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s weak&mdash;like most of us. He doesn&rsquo;t know what he wants.
      He doesn&rsquo;t grip on to life. But I like that man, and I&rsquo;m sorry for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Naturally enough she made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You despise him, Harriet, and you despise me. But you do us no good by
      it. We fools want some one to set us on our feet. Suppose a really decent
      woman had set up Gino&mdash;I believe Caroline Abbott might have done it&mdash;mightn&rsquo;t
      he have been another man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip,&rdquo; she interrupted, with an attempt at nonchalance, &ldquo;do you happen
      to have those matches handy? We might as well look at the baby again if
      you have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first match blew out immediately. So did the second. He suggested that
      they should stop the carriage and borrow the lamp from the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want all that bother. Try again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They entered the little wood as he tried to strike the third match. At
      last it caught. Harriet poised the umbrella rightly, and for a full
      quarter minute they contemplated the face that trembled in the light of
      the trembling flame. Then there was a shout and a crash. They were lying
      in the mud in darkness. The carriage had overturned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip was a good deal hurt. He sat up and rocked himself to and fro,
      holding his arm. He could just make out the outline of the carriage above
      him, and the outlines of the carriage cushions and of their luggage upon
      the grey road. The accident had taken place in the wood, where it was even
      darker than in the open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; he managed to say. Harriet was screaming, the horse
      was kicking, the driver was cursing some other man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harriet&rsquo;s screams became coherent. &ldquo;The baby&mdash;the baby&mdash;it
      slipped&mdash;it&rsquo;s gone from my arms&mdash;I stole it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God help me!&rdquo; said Philip. A cold circle came round his mouth, and, he
      fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he recovered it was still the same confusion. The horse was kicking,
      the baby had not been found, and Harriet still screamed like a maniac, &ldquo;I
      stole it! I stole it! I stole it! It slipped out of my arms!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep still!&rdquo; he commanded the driver. &ldquo;Let no one move. We may tread on
      it. Keep still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment they all obeyed him. He began to crawl through the mud,
      touching first this, then that, grasping the cushions by mistake,
      listening for the faintest whisper that might guide him. He tried to light
      a match, holding the box in his teeth and striking at it with the
      uninjured hand. At last he succeeded, and the light fell upon the bundle
      which he was seeking.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had rolled off the road into the wood a little way, and had fallen
      across a great rut. So tiny it was that had it fallen lengthways it would
      have disappeared, and he might never have found it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stole it! I and the idiot&mdash;no one was there.&rdquo; She burst out
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down and laid it on his knee. Then he tried to cleanse the face
      from the mud and the rain and the tears. His arm, he supposed, was broken,
      but he could still move it a little, and for the moment he forgot all
      pain. He was listening&mdash;not for a cry, but for the tick of a heart or
      the slightest tremor of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; called a voice. It was Miss Abbott, against whose
      carriage they had collided. She had relit one of the lamps, and was
      picking her way towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; he called again, and again they obeyed. He shook the bundle; he
      breathed into it; he opened his coat and pressed it against him. Then he
      listened, and heard nothing but the rain and the panting horses, and
      Harriet, who was somewhere chuckling to herself in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Abbott approached, and took it gently from him. The face was already
      chilly, but thanks to Philip it was no longer wet. Nor would it again be
      wetted by any tear.

    <h2>
      Chapter 9
    </h2>
    <p>
      The details of Harriet&rsquo;s crime were never known. In her illness she spoke
      more of the inlaid box that she lent to Lilia&mdash;lent, not given&mdash;than
      of recent troubles. It was clear that she had gone prepared for an
      interview with Gino, and finding him out, she had yielded to a grotesque
      temptation. But how far this was the result of ill-temper, to what extent
      she had been fortified by her religion, when and how she had met the poor
      idiot&mdash;these questions were never answered, nor did they interest
      Philip greatly. Detection was certain: they would have been arrested by
      the police of Florence or Milan, or at the frontier. As it was, they had
      been stopped in a simpler manner a few miles out of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      As yet he could scarcely survey the thing. It was too great. Round the
      Italian baby who had died in the mud there centred deep passions and high
      hopes. People had been wicked or wrong in the matter; no one save himself
      had been trivial. Now the baby had gone, but there remained this vast
      apparatus of pride and pity and love. For the dead, who seemed to take
      away so much, really take with them nothing that is ours. The passion they
      have aroused lives after them, easy to transmute or to transfer, but
      well-nigh impossible to destroy. And Philip knew that he was still
      voyaging on the same magnificent, perilous sea, with the sun or the clouds
      above him, and the tides below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The course of the moment&mdash;that, at all events, was certain. He and no
      one else must take the news to Gino. It was easy to talk of Harriet&rsquo;s
      crime&mdash;easy also to blame the negligent Perfetta or Mrs. Herriton at
      home. Every one had contributed&mdash;even Miss Abbott and Irma. If one
      chose, one might consider the catastrophe composite or the work of fate.
      But Philip did not so choose. It was his own fault, due to acknowledged
      weakness in his own character. Therefore he, and no one else, must take
      the news of it to Gino.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing prevented him. Miss Abbott was engaged with Harriet, and people
      had sprung out of the darkness and were conducting them towards some
      cottage. Philip had only to get into the uninjured carriage and order the
      driver to return. He was back at Monteriano after a two hours&rsquo; absence.
      Perfetta was in the house now, and greeted him cheerfully. Pain, physical
      and mental, had made him stupid. It was some time before he realized that
      she had never missed the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gino was still out. The woman took him to the reception-room, just as she
      had taken Miss Abbott in the morning, and dusted a circle for him on one
      of the horsehair chairs. But it was dark now, so she left the guest a
      little lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be as quick as I can,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;But there are many streets
      in Monteriano; he is sometimes difficult to find. I could not find him
      this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go first to the Caffe Garibaldi,&rdquo; said Philip, remembering that this was
      the hour appointed by his friends of yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      He occupied the time he was left alone not in thinking&mdash;there was
      nothing to think about; he simply had to tell a few facts&mdash;but in
      trying to make a sling for his broken arm. The trouble was in the
      elbow-joint, and as long as he kept this motionless he could go on as
      usual. But inflammation was beginning, and the slightest jar gave him
      agony. The sling was not fitted before Gino leapt up the stairs, crying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are back! How glad I am! We are all waiting&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip had seen too much to be nervous. In low, even tones he told what
      had happened; and the other, also perfectly calm, heard him to the end. In
      the silence Perfetta called up that she had forgotten the baby&rsquo;s evening
      milk; she must fetch it. When she had gone Gino took up the lamp without a
      word, and they went into the other room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister is ill,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;and Miss Abbott is guiltless. I should
      be glad if you did not have to trouble them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gino had stooped down by the way, and was feeling the place where his son
      had lain. Now and then he frowned a little and glanced at Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is through me,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;It happened because I was cowardly and
      idle. I have come to know what you will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gino had left the rug, and began to pat the table from the end, as if he
      was blind. The action was so uncanny that Philip was driven to intervene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gently, man, gently; he is not here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went up and touched him on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He twitched away, and began to pass his hands over things more rapidly&mdash;over
      the table, the chairs, the entire floor, the walls as high as he could
      reach them. Philip had not presumed to comfort him. But now the tension
      was too great&mdash;he tried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Break down, Gino; you must break down. Scream and curse and give in for a
      little; you must break down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no reply, and no cessation of the sweeping hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is time to be unhappy. Break down or you will be ill like my sister.
      You will go&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tour of the room was over. He had touched everything in it except
      Philip. Now he approached him. He face was that of a man who has lost his
      old reason for life and seeks a new one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gino!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped for a moment; then he came nearer. Philip stood his ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are to do what you like with me, Gino. Your son is dead, Gino. He
      died in my arms, remember. It does not excuse me; but he did die in my
      arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The left hand came forward, slowly this time. It hovered before Philip
      like an insect. Then it descended and gripped him by his broken elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip struck out with all the strength of his other arm. Gino fell to the
      blow without a cry or a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You brute!&rdquo; exclaimed the Englishman. &ldquo;Kill me if you like! But just you
      leave my broken arm alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he was seized with remorse, and knelt beside his adversary and tried
      to revive him. He managed to raise him up, and propped his body against
      his own. He passed his arm round him. Again he was filled with pity and
      tenderness. He awaited the revival without fear, sure that both of them
      were safe at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gino recovered suddenly. His lips moved. For one blessed moment it seemed
      that he was going to speak. But he scrambled up in silence, remembering
      everything, and he made not towards Philip, but towards the lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what you like; but think first&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lamp was tossed across the room, out through the loggia. It broke
      against one of the trees below. Philip began to cry out in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gino approached from behind and gave him a sharp pinch. Philip spun round
      with a yell. He had only been pinched on the back, but he knew what was in
      store for him. He struck out, exhorting the devil to fight him, to kill
      him, to do anything but this. Then he stumbled to the door. It was open.
      He lost his head, and, instead of turning down the stairs, he ran across
      the landing into the room opposite. There he lay down on the floor between
      the stove and the skirting-board.
    </p>
    <p>
      His senses grew sharper. He could hear Gino coming in on tiptoe. He even
      knew what was passing in his mind, how now he was at fault, now he was
      hopeful, now he was wondering whether after all the victim had not escaped
      down the stairs. There was a quick swoop above him, and then a low growl
      like a dog&rsquo;s. Gino had broken his finger-nails against the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      Physical pain is almost too terrible to bear. We can just bear it when it
      comes by accident or for our good&mdash;as it generally does in modern
      life&mdash;except at school. But when it is caused by the malignity of a
      man, full grown, fashioned like ourselves, all our control disappears.
      Philip&rsquo;s one thought was to get away from that room at whatever sacrifice
      of nobility or pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gino was now at the further end of the room, groping by the little tables.
      Suddenly the instinct came to him. He crawled quickly to where Philip lay
      and had him clean by the elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole arm seemed red-hot, and the broken bone grated in the joint,
      sending out shoots of the essence of pain. His other arm was pinioned
      against the wall, and Gino had trampled in behind the stove and was
      kneeling on his legs. For the space of a minute he yelled and yelled with
      all the force of his lungs. Then this solace was denied him. The other
      hand, moist and strong, began to close round his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first he was glad, for here, he thought, was death at last. But it was
      only a new torture; perhaps Gino inherited the skill of his ancestors&mdash;and
      childlike ruffians who flung each other from the towers. Just as the
      windpipe closed, the hand fell off, and Philip was revived by the motion
      of his arm. And just as he was about to faint and gain at last one moment
      of oblivion, the motion stopped, and he would struggle instead against the
      pressure on his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivid pictures were dancing through the pain&mdash;Lilia dying some months
      back in this very house, Miss Abbott bending over the baby, his mother at
      home, now reading evening prayers to the servants. He felt that he was
      growing weaker; his brain wandered; the agony did not seem so great. Not
      all Gino&rsquo;s care could indefinitely postpone the end. His yells and gurgles
      became mechanical&mdash;functions of the tortured flesh rather than true
      notes of indignation and despair. He was conscious of a horrid tumbling.
      Then his arm was pulled a little too roughly, and everything was quiet at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your son is dead, Gino. Your son is dead, dear Gino. Your son is
      dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The room was full of light, and Miss Abbott had Gino by the shoulders,
      holding him down in a chair. She was exhausted with the struggle, and her
      arms were trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the good of another death? What is the good of more pain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He too began to tremble. Then he turned and looked curiously at Philip,
      whose face, covered with dust and foam, was visible by the stove. Miss
      Abbott allowed him to get up, though she still held him firmly. He gave a
      loud and curious cry&mdash;a cry of interrogation it might be called.
      Below there was the noise of Perfetta returning with the baby&rsquo;s milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to him,&rdquo; said Miss Abbott, indicating Philip. &ldquo;Pick him up. Treat him
      kindly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She released him, and he approached Philip slowly. His eyes were filling
      with trouble. He bent down, as if he would gently raise him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo; moaned Philip. His body had suffered too much from Gino. It
      could not bear to be touched by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gino seemed to understand. He stopped, crouched above him. Miss Abbott
      herself came forward and lifted her friend in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the foul devil!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Kill him! Kill him for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Abbott laid him tenderly on the couch and wiped his face. Then she
      said gravely to them both, &ldquo;This thing stops here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Latte! latte!&rdquo; cried Perfetta, hilariously ascending the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;there is to be no revenge. I will have no more
      intentional evil. We are not to fight with each other any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never forgive him,&rdquo; sighed Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Latte! latte freschissima! bianca come neve!&rdquo; Perfetta came in with
      another lamp and a little jug.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gino spoke for the first time. &ldquo;Put the milk on the table,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It
      will not be wanted in the other room.&rdquo; The peril was over at last. A great
      sob shook the whole body, another followed, and then he gave a piercing
      cry of woe, and stumbled towards Miss Abbott like a child and clung to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      All through the day Miss Abbott had seemed to Philip like a goddess, and
      more than ever did she seem so now. Many people look younger and more
      intimate during great emotion. But some there are who look older, and
      remote, and he could not think that there was little difference in years,
      and none in composition, between her and the man whose head was laid upon
      her breast. Her eyes were open, full of infinite pity and full of majesty,
      as if they discerned the boundaries of sorrow, and saw unimaginable tracts
      beyond. Such eyes he had seen in great pictures but never in a mortal. Her
      hands were folded round the sufferer, stroking him lightly, for even a
      goddess can do no more than that. And it seemed fitting, too, that she
      should bend her head and touch his forehead with her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip looked away, as he sometimes looked away from the great pictures
      where visible forms suddenly become inadequate for the things they have
      shown to us. He was happy; he was assured that there was greatness in the
      world. There came to him an earnest desire to be good through the example
      of this good woman. He would try henceforward to be worthy of the things
      she had revealed. Quietly, without hysterical prayers or banging of drums,
      he underwent conversion. He was saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That milk,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;need not be wasted. Take it, Signor Carella, and
      persuade Mr. Herriton to drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gino obeyed her, and carried the child&rsquo;s milk to Philip. And Philip obeyed
      also and drank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little,&rdquo; answered Gino.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then finish it.&rdquo; For she was determined to use such remnants as lie about
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not have some?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not care for milk; finish it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip, have you had enough milk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thank you, Gino; finish it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drank the milk, and then, either by accident or in some spasm of pain,
      broke the jug to pieces. Perfetta exclaimed in bewilderment. &ldquo;It does not
      matter,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;It does not matter. It will never be wanted any
      more.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;He will have to marry her,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;I heard from him this morning,
      just as we left Milan. He finds he has gone too far to back out. It would
      be expensive. I don&rsquo;t know how much he minds&mdash;not as much as we
      suppose, I think. At all events there&rsquo;s not a word of blame in the letter.
      I don&rsquo;t believe he even feels angry. I never was so completely forgiven.
      Ever since you stopped him killing me, it has been a vision of perfect
      friendship. He nursed me, he lied for me at the inquest, and at the
      funeral, though he was crying, you would have thought it was my son who
      had died. Certainly I was the only person he had to be kind to; he was so
      distressed not to make Harriet&rsquo;s acquaintance, and that he scarcely saw
      anything of you. In his letter he says so again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank him, please, when you write,&rdquo; said Miss Abbott, &ldquo;and give him my
      kindest regards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I will.&rdquo; He was surprised that she could slide away from the man
      so easily. For his own part, he was bound by ties of almost alarming
      intimacy. Gino had the southern knack of friendship. In the intervals of
      business he would pull out Philip&rsquo;s life, turn it inside out, remodel it,
      and advise him how to use it for the best. The sensation was pleasant, for
      he was a kind as well as a skilful operator. But Philip came away feeling
      that he had not a secret corner left. In that very letter Gino had again
      implored him, as a refuge from domestic difficulties, &ldquo;to marry Miss
      Abbott, even if her dowry is small.&rdquo; And how Miss Abbott herself, after
      such tragic intercourse, could resume the conventions and send calm
      messages of esteem, was more than he could understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will you see him again?&rdquo; she asked. They were standing together in
      the corridor of the train, slowly ascending out of Italy towards the San
      Gothard tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope next spring. Perhaps we shall paint Siena red for a day or two
      with some of the new wife&rsquo;s money. It was one of the arguments for
      marrying her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has no heart,&rdquo; she said severely. &ldquo;He does not really mind about the
      child at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you&rsquo;re wrong. He does. He is unhappy, like the rest of us. But he
      doesn&rsquo;t try to keep up appearances as we do. He knows that the things that
      have made him happy once will probably make him happy again&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he would never be happy again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his passion. Not when he was calm. We English say it when we are calm&mdash;when
      we do not really believe it any longer. Gino is not ashamed of
      inconsistency. It is one of the many things I like him for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I was wrong. That is so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s much more honest with himself than I am,&rdquo; continued Philip, &ldquo;and he
      is honest without an effort and without pride. But you, Miss Abbott, what
      about you? Will you be in Italy next spring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. When will you come back, do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For whatever reason?&rdquo; He stared at her as if she were some monstrosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I understand the place. There is no need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Understand Italy!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t. And I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; he murmured to himself, as he
      paced away from her up the corridor. By this time he loved her very much,
      and he could not bear to be puzzled. He had reached love by the spiritual
      path: her thoughts and her goodness and her nobility had moved him first,
      and now her whole body and all its gestures had become transfigured by
      them. The beauties that are called obvious&mdash;the beauties of her hair
      and her voice and her limbs&mdash;he had noticed these last; Gino, who
      never traversed any path at all, had commended them dispassionately to his
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why was he so puzzling? He had known so much about her once&mdash;what she
      thought, how she felt, the reasons for her actions. And now he only knew
      that he loved her, and all the other knowledge seemed passing from him
      just as he needed it most. Why would she never come to Italy again? Why
      had she avoided himself and Gino ever since the evening that she had saved
      their lives? The train was nearly empty. Harriet slumbered in a
      compartment by herself. He must ask her these questions now, and he
      returned quickly to her down the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      She greeted him with a question of her own. &ldquo;Are your plans decided?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I can&rsquo;t live at Sawston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you told Mrs. Herriton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wrote from Monteriano. I tried to explain things; but she will never
      understand me. Her view will be that the affair is settled&mdash;sadly
      settled since the baby is dead. Still it&rsquo;s over; our family circle need be
      vexed no more. She won&rsquo;t even be angry with you. You see, you have done us
      no harm in the long run. Unless, of course, you talk about Harriet and
      make a scandal. So that is my plan&mdash;London and work. What is yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Harriet!&rdquo; said Miss Abbott. &ldquo;As if I dare judge Harriet! Or
      anybody.&rdquo; And without replying to Philip&rsquo;s question she left him to visit
      the other invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip gazed after her mournfully, and then he looked mournfully out of
      the window at the decreasing streams. All the excitement was over&mdash;the
      inquest, Harriet&rsquo;s short illness, his own visit to the surgeon. He was
      convalescent, both in body and spirit, but convalescence brought no joy.
      In the looking-glass at the end of the corridor he saw his face haggard,
      and his shoulders pulled forward by the weight of the sling. Life was
      greater than he had supposed, but it was even less complete. He had seen
      the need for strenuous work and for righteousness. And now he saw what a
      very little way those things would go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Harriet going to be all right?&rdquo; he asked. Miss Abbott had come back to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will soon be her old self,&rdquo; was the reply. For Harriet, after a short
      paroxysm of illness and remorse, was quickly returning to her normal
      state. She had been &ldquo;thoroughly upset&rdquo; as she phrased it, but she soon
      ceased to realize that anything was wrong beyond the death of a poor
      little child. Already she spoke of &ldquo;this unlucky accident,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the
      mysterious frustration of one&rsquo;s attempts to make things better.&rdquo; Miss
      Abbott had seen that she was comfortable, and had given her a kind kiss.
      But she returned feeling that Harriet, like her mother, considered the
      affair as settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m clear enough about Harriet&rsquo;s future, and about parts of my own. But I
      ask again, What about yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sawston and work,&rdquo; said Miss Abbott.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she asked, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen too much. You&rsquo;ve seen as much and done more than I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s so different. Of course I shall go to Sawston. You forget my
      father; and even if he wasn&rsquo;t there, I&rsquo;ve a hundred ties: my district&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      neglecting it shamefully&mdash;my evening classes, the St. James&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly nonsense!&rdquo; he exploded, suddenly moved to have the whole thing out
      with her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too good&mdash;about a thousand times better than I am.
      You can&rsquo;t live in that hole; you must go among people who can hope to
      understand you. I mind for myself. I want to see you often&mdash;again and
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we shall meet whenever you come down; and I hope that it will
      mean often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not enough; it&rsquo;ll only be in the old horrible way, each with a dozen
      relatives round us. No, Miss Abbott; it&rsquo;s not good enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can write at all events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will write?&rdquo; he cried, with a flush of pleasure. At times his hopes
      seemed so solid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I say it&rsquo;s not enough&mdash;you can&rsquo;t go back to the old life if you
      wanted to. Too much has happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; she said sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not only pain and sorrow, but wonderful things: that tower in the
      sunlight&mdash;do you remember it, and all you said to me? The theatre,
      even. And the next day&mdash;in the church; and our times with Gino.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the wonderful things are over,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That is just where it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it. At all events not for me. The most wonderful things
      may be to come&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wonderful things are over,&rdquo; she repeated, and looked at him so
      mournfully that he dare not contradict her. The train was crawling up the
      last ascent towards the Campanile of Airolo and the entrance of the
      tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Abbott,&rdquo; he murmured, speaking quickly, as if their free intercourse
      might soon be ended, &ldquo;what is the matter with you? I thought I understood
      you, and I don&rsquo;t. All those two great first days at Monteriano I read you
      as clearly as you read me still. I saw why you had come, and why you
      changed sides, and afterwards I saw your wonderful courage and pity. And
      now you&rsquo;re frank with me one moment, as you used to be, and the next
      moment you shut me up. You see I owe too much to you&mdash;my life, and I
      don&rsquo;t know what besides. I won&rsquo;t stand it. You&rsquo;ve gone too far to turn
      mysterious. I&rsquo;ll quote what you said to me: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be mysterious; there
      isn&rsquo;t the time.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll quote something else: &lsquo;I and my life must be where I
      live.&rsquo; You can&rsquo;t live at Sawston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had moved her at last. She whispered to herself hurriedly. &ldquo;It is
      tempting&mdash;&rdquo; And those three words threw him into a tumult of joy.
      What was tempting to her? After all was the greatest of things possible?
      Perhaps, after long estrangement, after much tragedy, the South had
      brought them together in the end. That laughter in the theatre, those
      silver stars in the purple sky, even the violets of a departed spring, all
      had helped, and sorrow had helped also, and so had tenderness to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is tempting,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;not to be mysterious. I&rsquo;ve wanted often
      to tell you, and then been afraid. I could never tell any one else,
      certainly no woman, and I think you&rsquo;re the one man who might understand
      and not be disgusted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you lonely?&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Is it anything like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The train seemed to shake him towards her. He was resolved that
      though a dozen people were looking, he would yet take her in his arms.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly lonely, or I wouldn&rsquo;t speak. I think you must know already.&rdquo;
       Their faces were crimson, as if the same thought was surging through them
      both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I do.&rdquo; He came close to her. &ldquo;Perhaps I could speak instead. But
      if you will say the word plainly you&rsquo;ll never be sorry; I will thank you
      for it all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said plainly, &ldquo;That I love him.&rdquo; Then she broke down. Her body was
      shaken with sobs, and lest there should be any doubt she cried between the
      sobs for Gino! Gino! Gino!
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard himself remark &ldquo;Rather! I love him too! When I can forget how he
      hurt me that evening. Though whenever we shake hands&mdash;&rdquo; One of them
      must have moved a step or two, for when she spoke again she was already a
      little way apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve upset me.&rdquo; She stifled something that was perilously near
      hysterics. &ldquo;I thought I was past all this. You&rsquo;re taking it wrongly. I&rsquo;m
      in love with Gino&mdash;don&rsquo;t pass it off&mdash;I mean it crudely&mdash;you
      know what I mean. So laugh at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laugh at love?&rdquo; asked Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Pull it to pieces. Tell me I&rsquo;m a fool or worse&mdash;that he&rsquo;s a
      cad. Say all you said when Lilia fell in love with him. That&rsquo;s the help I
      want. I dare tell you this because I like you&mdash;and because you&rsquo;re
      without passion; you look on life as a spectacle; you don&rsquo;t enter it; you
      only find it funny or beautiful. So I can trust you to cure me. Mr.
      Herriton, isn&rsquo;t it funny?&rdquo; She tried to laugh herself, but became
      frightened and had to stop. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a gentleman, nor a Christian, nor
      good in any way. He&rsquo;s never flattered me nor honoured me. But because he&rsquo;s
      handsome, that&rsquo;s been enough. The son of an Italian dentist, with a pretty
      face.&rdquo; She repeated the phrase as if it was a charm against passion. &ldquo;Oh,
      Mr. Herriton, isn&rsquo;t it funny!&rdquo; Then, to his relief, she began to cry. &ldquo;I
      love him, and I&rsquo;m not ashamed of it. I love him, and I&rsquo;m going to Sawston,
      and if I mayn&rsquo;t speak about him to you sometimes, I shall die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In that terrible discovery Philip managed to think not of himself but of
      her. He did not lament. He did not even speak to her kindly, for he saw
      that she could not stand it. A flippant reply was what she asked and
      needed&mdash;something flippant and a little cynical. And indeed it was
      the only reply he could trust himself to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is what the books call &lsquo;a passing fancy&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. Even this question was too pathetic. For as far as she
      knew anything about herself, she knew that her passions, once aroused,
      were sure. &ldquo;If I saw him often,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I might remember what he is
      like. Or he might grow old. But I dare not risk it, so nothing can alter
      me now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if the fancy does pass, let me know.&rdquo; After all, he could say what
      he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you shall know quick enough&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But before you retire to Sawston&mdash;are you so mighty sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of?&rdquo; She had stopped crying. He was treating her exactly as she had
      hoped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you and he&mdash;&rdquo; He smiled bitterly at the thought of them
      together. Here was the cruel antique malice of the gods, such as they once
      sent forth against Pasiphae. Centuries of aspiration and culture&mdash;and
      the world could not escape it. &ldquo;I was going to say&mdash;whatever have you
      got in common?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing except the times we have seen each other.&rdquo; Again her face was
      crimson. He turned his own face away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which&mdash;which times?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time I thought you weak and heedless, and went instead of you to get
      the baby. That began it, as far as I know the beginning. Or it may have
      begun when you took us to the theatre, and I saw him mixed up with music
      and light. But didn&rsquo;t understand till the morning. Then you opened the
      door&mdash;and I knew why I had been so happy. Afterwards, in the church,
      I prayed for us all; not for anything new, but that we might just be as we
      were&mdash;he with the child he loved, you and I and Harriet safe out of
      the place&mdash;and that I might never see him or speak to him again. I
      could have pulled through then&mdash;the thing was only coming near, like
      a wreath of smoke; it hadn&rsquo;t wrapped me round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But through my fault,&rdquo; said Philip solemnly, &ldquo;he is parted from the child
      he loves. And because my life was in danger you came and saw him and spoke
      to him again.&rdquo; For the thing was even greater than she imagined. Nobody
      but himself would ever see round it now. And to see round it he was
      standing at an immense distance. He could even be glad that she had once
      held the beloved in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of &lsquo;faults.&rsquo; You&rsquo;re my friend for ever, Mr. Herriton, I think.
      Only don&rsquo;t be charitable and shift or take the blame. Get over supposing
      I&rsquo;m refined. That&rsquo;s what puzzles you. Get over that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke she seemed to be transfigured, and to have indeed no part with
      refinement or unrefinement any longer. Out of this wreck there was
      revealed to him something indestructible&mdash;something which she, who
      had given it, could never take away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say again, don&rsquo;t be charitable. If he had asked me, I might have given
      myself body and soul. That would have been the end of my rescue party. But
      all through he took me for a superior being&mdash;a goddess. I who was
      worshipping every inch of him, and every word he spoke. And that saved
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on the Campanile of Airolo. But he saw instead
      the fair myth of Endymion. This woman was a goddess to the end. For her no
      love could be degrading: she stood outside all degradation. This episode,
      which she thought so sordid, and which was so tragic for him, remained
      supremely beautiful. To such a height was he lifted, that without regret
      he could now have told her that he was her worshipper too. But what was
      the use of telling her? For all the wonderful things had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; was all that he permitted himself. &ldquo;Thank you for
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with great friendliness, for he had made her life
      endurable. At that moment the train entered the San Gothard tunnel. They
      hurried back to the carriage to close the windows lest the smuts should
      get into Harriet&rsquo;s eyes.

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
